            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Math. 25-24. remembring alſo, that Chriſt made it an eſſentiall marke of Peters loue vnto him, To fecd his Lambes: Ioh. 21.15. And, that it is giuen in charge to all, to exhorte one another, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one another, &amp; to edifie one another 1. Th. 5.11.14. I durſt not for feare, nor could I for
<pb facs="tcp:21142:3"/>loue, but make knovvn my minde in this pointe: To ſee the Church and Spouſe of Chriſt, to lye in the weekly breach of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Commandement, by violating and prophaning of the Lords ſacred tyme and Sabbath (a ſine of ignorance hether to I confeſſe) and in meane tyme ſuperſtitiouſly ſanctifying a day, the firſt day of the weeke for a Sabbath, which God, nor Chriſt, nor any of his Apoſtles euer commanded or appointed: how could my ſpirit but be ſtirred within mee, to ſhew vnto hir this errour, and to declare vnto hir, which day is that righte and true day, which God requireth of hir: and the Rather, ſince God hath put it into hir hart, wilingly to giue God a day: for, this laſt and honourable Parliament (bleſſed be God for their zeale and Godly care) hath enacted a Law for the better keeping holy of the Lords day. I know, for my good will &amp; loue, I ſhall reape euill vvill and hatred; and for this paynes I ſhall vndergoe moſt harſh &amp; bitter cenſures, but bleſſed are ye (ſaid Chriſt) when men ſpeak euill of you falſely for my ſake. They will ſay as ſome allreedy doe ſay, tis pride and ſingularity that ſetes me on vvorke; To vvhom I anſvvere in Pauls vvords 1. Cor. 4. I knovv no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by my ſelfe, yet am I not thereby iuſtified; but if it be, I beſeech God pardone the ſyne, but bleſſe this work.

            <head>The Lords day, is not Sabbath day, by Divine inſtitution.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E pleaſed (Chriſtian Reader) firſt of all to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, that we now a dayes apply the name Sabbath, to the Lords day, Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuoſly &amp; without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without warrant of holy Scriptures, ſince Scripture ſaith the ſeven<hi rend="sup">th</hi> daye is the Sabbath, Exod: 20:10. And all the Euangeliſts call the Lords day, the firſt day of the weeke, Matth: 28:1. So then there is as much difference twixt theſe two as is betweene the ſeventh and the firſt: the laſt day of the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, Saturday, and the firſt day of the weeke, Sunday. Now, thus to confounde two proper names of dayes, is as if wee ſhould call Sunday, Saturday. And I deſire it rather to be noted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ignorance of this point is of dangerous conſequence amongſt the commone people,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21142:5"/>who when they heare the 4.<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: Remember the Sabbath day &amp;c. or thoſe words Iſa: 58: and call the Sabbath a delight, to conſecrate it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Lord: &amp;c: they think preſently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Lords day, the firſt day of the weeke, as if thoſe texts commanded this day. Whereas they point at Sabbath day the ſeventh and laſt day of the weeke. Such a miſtake in a leaſe or bonde might procure a forfeiture of them, with man, beware we then, leaſt by the like, wee forfeite with God in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Com:</p>
            <p>In the next place let vs examine the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities &amp; textes of Scripture, which vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are alleaged for profe that the Lords day is a Sabbath by Gods apointment, wherein I will ſhewe the invalidity &amp; inſufficiencey of thos textes by waye of anſwere to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let vs begine with the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Com: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbath day &amp;c: this precept is vrged vpon the Lords day that we ſhould Sanctify it.</p>
            <p>Here to I anſwere by denyall that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement doth vrge the Lords day; the reaſon of my denyall is. 1: becauſe the Com: enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a day whoſe proper name is Sabbath day, like as Saturday with vs is a proper name of one of our weeke dayes: But the Lords day, is not Sabbath day, for, it is the daye after the Sabbath day; &amp; it is a proper name for an other of our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21142:5"/>weeke dayes, that is for Sunday, or for the firſt day of the weeke: 2. Becauſe the Com: enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, which is the laſt daye of the weeke; but the Lords daye is the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. daye, or the firſt daye of the weeke, by the accounte of all men. And it is no leſſe abſurde to preſſe the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Com. which enioynes the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day for a Sabbath, to the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. daye, or to the firſt daye: then it had been for the Iſraelites out of that Com: Levit: 25.2.3.4. The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. yeere ſhall be a Sabbath of reſt vnto the Land &amp;c. to preſſe this Com: vnto the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. yeere or to the firſt yeere for the lands reſt. 3. Becauſe the Com: enioyneth that day which the Lord God himſelf reſted on, &amp; the which he bleſſed &amp; hallowed Exod: 20:11. but our Lords daye is not the day God reſted on nor did God in the creatione, bleſſe ſanctify &amp; hallowe our Lords daye or firſt daye of the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke; nay he wrought one it himſelfe, &amp; appointed it for a workeing daye to man, when he ſaide 6. dayes ſhalt thou labour &amp; doe all thou haſt to doe Exod: 20:9. of which 6. dayes our Lords day is one, &amp; the firſt. But here vnto it will be replied, true, the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Com: did once enioyne the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. daye, Sabbath, but ſince the daye is altered &amp; changed by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, ſo that now the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Com: is changed too, &amp; bindes to the newe daye, though not properly, yet Analogically &amp; by waye of reſemblance: I anſwere, the word
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21142:6"/>(Change) betokeneth two thinges, the one is an abolition or remoueing the ould, the other is an aſſumption or takeing vp of a newe; as 2. Sam. 12.20. David changed his apparell: that is, he put off his mourning attire, and he put one other apparell: now I deny that euer Chriſt, or his Apoſtles did thus change the Sabbath day either by there precept or practiſe; did the Apoſtles ſo preache one the Lords day, as they ceaſed preaching one the Sabbath day, the day before the Lords day? can this be proued? for this is a change properly: is not the contrary manifeſt, to wit that the Apoſtles did conſtantly preach one the Sabbath dayes? ſee Act. 13.14.42.44. Act. 16.13. Act. 17.2. Act. 18.4. if then they alſo preached one the Lords dayes too, why this is no alteration or change though, it is but an addition of a day, and a ſettinge vp of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sabbath daye a newe, and ſo you may haue two Sabbathes in euery weeke if you will.</p>

In reference to God the Redeemer, it might be called the Lords day, as the day is wherein Chriſt will come to Indgment Luk: 17:24, 30. that is a day wherein Chriſt will ſhewe himſelfe Maruailouſe to the world, ſo did Chriſt in the day of his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Paſſion, Reſurrection and Aſcention, in euery of thes he did a remarkable worke, and euery of thes might be called the Lords day, and which of them Iohn had reſpect vnto Scripture is altogether ſilent, and therfore can we not buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vpon infallible growndes herein, and we muſt not ſet vp Sabbathes, tyeinge mens conſciences vpon probabilities and contingencies: further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, who wold argue from Luk: 17:24. that becauſe the day of Iudgment is called Chriſts day, Therfore that day muſt then be kept for a Sabbath day? but admit S. Iohn meant the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, that is a day wherein he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21142:8"/>would declare himſelfe mightely to be the Sonne of God, by the reſurrection from the dead Rom: 1:4. What is this to a Sabbath, which men muſt celebrate? how doth it appeare Chriſt roſe one this day, and called it the Lords day, with this intendement that men ſhold for euer after kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe it a Sabbath? ſhewe me an inſtitution of a Sabbath day by Chriſts riſeing one this day, or by S.

            <p>I anſwer ſecondly, by (day) in the Pſalme is not neceſſarily vnderſtod a ſhorte ordinary day of 12. or 24. howres, but rather a long ſpace of tyme, as all the tyme after Dauid came to the Crowne; and ſo it may be applied to type out the whole tyme of Chriſt vpon the earth ruleing as King in the Kingdom of his Church, thus Abraham ſawe Chriſts day Ioh. 8.56. thus tis called the day of Saluation 2. Cor. 6.2. If then by day here be meante the day of grace, or the tyme of Chriſts abode one the earth, then heer is no footing for a Sabbath day of 12. or 24. howres long.</p>

            <p>Here to I anſwere, 1. That Peters actions are no diuine inſtitutions, vnleſſe backt by ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, now nor Chriſt nor his Apoſtles gaue any precept for performance of thes duties one this day.</p>

            <p>Thus haue I anſwered their textes of Scripture brought for the Lords daye to be a Sabbath, and the common objections; now let vs in next place examine their reaſons whereby the Lords day is proued a Sabbath.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt reaſon is drawne from the freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and conſtant practiſe of Chriſt and of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles celebration of the Lords day, the which is authority ſufficient for juſtification of the Lords day to be a Sabbatth:</p>
            <p>I anſwere 1. admit Chriſt and his Apoſtles did preache on the Lords day, &amp; thereby honour this day aboue any of the 6. working dayes, yet how doth it appeare they did this on this day to this very ende and purpoſe to ſanctifye it for a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21142:15"/>Sabbath daye, and in obedience to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Com? let theſe 2. things be proued, or elſe nothing is done.</p>
            <p>I anſwere 2. as touching our Sauiour Chriſt, vvhereas tis ſuppoſed he conſtantly kept the Lords day as a Sabbath: I deny it, let it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that euer Chriſt did ſanctifye as a Sabbath any on Lords day: Nay is not the contrary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that Chriſt trauailed a matter of 15. miles out and home vpon the very firſt Lords day that euer was, it beinge the moſt eminent Lords day of any euer after, becauſe it was that very Lords day whereone he roſe from the dead? ſee Luk. 24.13.33. Chriſt we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the 2. Diſciples from Ieruſalem to Emmaus v. 15. which is in accounte 7. miles and an halfe, counting 8. furlonges to a myle: &amp; thence he returned to Ieruſalem backe againe that night, which is 7. myles and an halfe more: now 15. myles is aboue a Sabbath dayes Iourney, ſince a Sabbath dayes Iourney is in eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but about 2. myles Act. 1.12. Neighther can it be proued, Chriſt went to Emmaus to preach and keepe Sabbath there, for 1. he went from the Congregation of his Diſciples which he lefte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde at Ieruſalem, and we reade not of any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyes of Diſciples that were at Emmaus; now Chriſt beinge the paſtor of his flocke, and the miniſter or preacher to his Diſciples, can it be thought he vvold leaue them deſtitute of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21142:16"/>helpe to ſanctify the firſt Chriſtian Sabbath that euer the Church ſawe? 2. how cold Chriſt keepe that day for a Sabbath ſince he was not in the Congregation, but in the field travailing, from about noone (as is gatherable from circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the texte) and ſo forwards all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that after noone; for he went alonge with the 2. Diſciples, &amp; they went not aboue a matter of 2. miles an howre, as is probable by the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pace of trauailers, ſo then 15. miles ſpent them a matter of 7. howres: Had Chriſt imitated God in the creation (as is ſuppoſed) in ſetting vp a Sabbath day, then ſurely as God did reſt on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, and ſet vs his owne paterne: ſo would Chriſt haue reſted all this Lords day after the worke of redemption, to haue bene an example to vs. what if Chriſt being riſen from the dead cold now trauaile without paine? ſo cold God in the Creation create without paine, yet wold he leaue nothing to be created on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, but reſted on it, for vs to imitate him. and Adam in Innocency cold labor without paine, yet he muſt reſt on the Sabbath daye, and what if Chriſt did open the Scriptures concerning himſelfe v.27. to the 2. Diſciples as they went on their way toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt this therefore be a proper Sabbath dayes worke? as the Lord by Moſes commanded (Deut. 6.6.7.) parentes, that they ſhold talke to their children of the Law of God as they walked
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21142:16"/>by the way &amp;c. on what day ſo euer; and as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Godly miniſter now rideing on the way vpon a Saturday towards Market or fayer, will vpon occaſion be talking to people that ride with him of heauenly and diuine things, ſo much rather wold our bleſſed Sauiour be teaching, and vpon all occaſions inſtructing the people vpon euery day; eſpecially conſideringe it was his office to teache, and therfore a daily taske to preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon vpon all occaſions, as we reade he did in the Goſpell, and as we reade Act. 1.3. Chriſt was ſeene of his Apoſtles for 40. dayes after his reſurrection, ſpeaking to them of the things appertaining to the Kingdome of God. now what did Chriſt preache more to theſe 2. Diſciples, on that Lords day, then he preached to his Apoſtles euery day after it for 40. dayes together? To add one thing more, be it, you make exceptions againſt Chriſts trauailing one the Lords day, what exceptions doe you finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the 2. Diſciples of Chriſt, with whome Chriſt travailed? theſe trauailed one the Lords day, Chriſt himſelfe not diſallowing, but by his companying them juſtifyed them. they vvent from the Congregation of Diſciples at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem where the Sabbath was kept, if any where, they went to a towne not to keepe Sabbath for it was neere night ere they got thither, and they but ſtaied and ſupped and came backe againe;

            <p>I anſwere 2. Be it that Saturday Sabbath being abrogated, an other Sabbath muſt riſe vp in its roome, yet it followeth not that Sunday, or the Lords day, on firſt day of the vveeke muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be the new day, for there may be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath though none vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt day of the weeke, if there be one kept vpon any of the 6. dayes, Moneday, Tewſday, Wenſday, or Thurſday &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But hereto it vvill be ſaid though the newe Sabbath may be on any of the 6. dayes, yet we ought to chooſe the firſt day of the weeke before all others, becauſe on it vve receiued a greater a greater bleſſing then one any other of the 6. dayes, ſince on that day our Lord Chriſt roſe from the dead, and therfore it is caled the Lords day. I anſwere 1. be it ſo that in chooſinge a day, vve ought to take that day which hath neere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the greateſt bleſſing, yet vvold we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God in inſtituting a Sabbath at Creation, we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21142:18"/>ſhold not ſet a parte for a Sabbath that very day vvhereon vve receiued that bleſſing, or whereon Chriſt performed it, but the day after it, ſo God hauing finiſhed his vvorke of creation on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, he then ſanctifyed the day after, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day: &amp; ſo it ſeemeth the beleeuing Iewes learned of God to ſet a parte the day after a deliueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, not the very day, ſee Eſter 9.17.18. vvhere the Iewes that conquered their enemies on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day of the moneth, they reſted on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day of the month, and keept it a day of feaſting and ioye; and thoſe Iewes that conquered on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. dayes, they reſted on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. daye: But vve immitate neither God, nor thoſe Godly Iewes, for vve reſt vpon the very day where on we receiued that great bleſſing, that is vpon the firſt day of the weeke, wherein the Lord roſe; and we ſhold reſt rather on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the vveeke, which is Moneday: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere 2. be it ſo, that the Lords day were to be kept of vs aboue any other day, in memory of the reſurrection of our Lord, yet it followeth not that vve ſhold count and keepe euery firſt day of the vveeke, and one day in 7. for a Sabbath, for this were Iewiſh (as it is caled) and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God in the creation; but we Chriſtians haue an other patterne, that is Chriſt the Lord and Redemer to imitate, and that in reſpect of the worke of Redemption: So as if we hold it beſt to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21142:19"/>ſanctify the very day whereon Chriſt roſe; why then muſt we ſanctifye euery third day for our new Sabbath, and cale and counte euery third day ſince the firſt Lords day vvhereon Chriſt roſe, The Lords day; let it fale vpon the firſt day of the weeke, or on the 2<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. or 3<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. or 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. &amp;c. one any day of the weeke: my reaſon is becauſe the Scriptures telleth vs that our Lord Chriſt roſe vpon the 3<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. daye, as God reſted on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day; ſo then Chriſt being crucified one good Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and riſeing againe one our Suneday, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares he was but 3. dayes vpon the worke of redemption: Now if vve Chriſtians muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt in the worke of redemption, as did the Iewes God in the worke of creation, Then looke as God working 6. dayes and reſting the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. the Iewes alſo wrought 6. dayes and reſted the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. So as Chriſt was 3. dayes, or 3. partes of 3. dayes, in the worke of redemption, and reſted from the ſame ſufferings on the third day, In like manner ſhold we Chriſtians in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt worke 3. dayes, or 3. partes of three dayes, and reſt on the third, keeping it for a Sabbath: So we ſhold not then keepe theſe we now call Lords dayes for our Sabbath but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor keepe a Sabbath once in 7. dayes, but ont once euery 3. dayes.</p>
            <p>I anſwere now to the reaſon whereby they wold chooſe out the Lords day afore any other
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21142:19"/>of the 6. dayes for a Sabbath, becauſe on that day we receiued the Lord from the dead, the greateſt worke and mercy that euer we receiued &amp;c. here vnto I anſwere, if the greateſt worke ſhall determine the day, which it ſhall be, Then in myn account as farr at yet I can ſee, good Friday ſhold be our new Sabbath day: for on that day Chriſt performed the greateſt work of any other day; let vs therefore compare theſe 3. dayes vvorkes; on good Friday (not to mention the the particulares of his grieueouſſe paſſion) Chriſt vpon the croſſe hanging there in our roomes, bare that moſt intollerable and inſupportable wrath of God, which was due for the ſins of all Gods elect, from beginning to the end of the world, vvhich wrath was ſo hote as cauſed him to vtter theſe words, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? and then as hauing borne the vtmoſt of his fathers wrath for ſins of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, he yeelded vp his Spirit with theſe words, It is finiſhed, Ioh. 19.30. as for the next day, the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. day of his paſſion, our Saturday, and ſo alſo for the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. day of his paſſion, our Sunday, vntill he roſe, what cold he ſuffer? his ſoule vvas in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, his body in the graue dead and ſenſeleſſe: now judge vvhither of theſe 3. dayes had the greateſt worke done in, in which of them but Friday was the greateſt paſſion? or if you vvill compare Chriſts reſurrection with his paſſion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21142:20"/>I truſt it vvill be fond a greater vvorke for his Deity to ſupporte the Humanity vpon the croſſe, then to ſend his ſoule from heauen into his dead body in the graue to quicken and raiſe it vp.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay on the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. day Chriſt roſe, with out which all the former had beene inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient 1. Cor. 15.14. if Chriſt be not riſen our preaching, and your faith is in vaine &amp;c. and Chriſt died for our ſines, and roſe againe for our juſtification, Rom. 4.25. ſo that it is rather the day wherein all was perfectly finiſhed, then the day wherin the greateſt worke was done, that we ſhold keepe for our Sabbath: where to I anſwere 1. Chriſt vpon the croſſe on good Friday ſaid then, it is finiſhed Ioh. 19.30. ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, if you will ſtay for a day where in euery complement vvas fulfilled, then muſt you make your Sabbath on Aſcentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day being Thurſday: or rather you muſt tarry till the worlds end: till Chriſt hath conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſines &amp; death, 1. Cor. 15.26.56. if therfore by reaſons we ſhall inſtitute Sabbathes, it may be thought good Friday is the only day for our new Sabbath, or elſe to tarry till this worlds end.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. &amp; maine reaſon of all is to this effect; If the Iewes kept a Sabbath in memory of Gods Creation, Then much more ought Chriſtians keepe an other Sabbath in memory of Chriſts Redemption: and the common reaſon hereof is,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21142:20"/>becauſe the worke of Redemption is a greater worke then the worke of Creation.</p>
            <p>I anſwere 1. the reaſon is not the ſame, and therfore it followeth not; for the Iewes they did not ſet vp a Sabbath on their owne heads, with out a precept for their direction, only to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the creation, if they had, it had beene no better then will worſhip, but they ſtayed for a Commandement from the God of the creation to command them a Sabbath by his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm: and to tell them which day of the 7. to keepe; &amp; it was Gods Commandement principally that ſet them one worke to keep a Sabbath; novv this which is the maine for the keeping of a Sabbath day, is left ont in their argument, as if Gods Comm: were but a by thing and not neceſſarily preſuppoſed in euery Sabbath: wherfore let them put into their argument the main and principall thing mouing the Iewes to keepe the Sabbath, that is Gods 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: and then I fault not their argument, as novv I doe, but I bide them proue likewiſe that we Chriſtians haue ſuch ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to keep our Lords day a Sabbath, as Jevves had for their day, that is, I require to ſhew me where Chriſt or his Apoſtles left vs an expreſſe Commandement to ſanctify the Lords day, as God did to the Iewes to ſanctify the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, and then I ſay indeed, If the Iewes kept the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, vve Chriſtians ought keep the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day. Or thus

            <p>Hauing anſwered all their reaſons that I can finde or heare of, in next place let me paſſe my cenſure of reaſons in generall.

To come yet nerer home, to our owne diuines; was it not hence that Perkins though a greate frend to the Lords day for Sabbath, as Walaeus on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> com: quoteth him, thus Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins ingenuouſly (ſaith he) confeſſeth, that as touching Chriſts inſtitution, the argumentes he bringes for our Lords day, they be not neceſſary, but only probable ones &amp;c. and ſee Perk: caſes of conſcience chapt. 16. vvhere the holy man durſt not ſpeake to the conſcience peremptorily as of a thing for certaine true, but tremblingly as it were, repeatinge his doubtfull ſpeeches, 3. or 4. tymes ouer, in 6. or 8. lines wrighting as 1.

Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? pag. 140. Againe, where (ſaith he) amongſt the Euangeliſts, or Apoſtles, is there any diſtinct inſtitution of the Lords day? yea further, where is the texte whence you will neceſſarily proue it? vvhat ſhould I reckone vp particular men, is it not the doctrine of our churche? very lately a booke came to my hands, printed at Oxford in the yeere 1621. written by M. Broad, touching the Sabbath, where on the margent pag. 2. thus he wrighteth; Chriſtian people choſe the firſt day of the weeke, and made it their Sabbath, ſaith the booke of Homilies: By the doctrine then of our church, ſaith M. Broad, the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day, is an Eccleſiaſticall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and not an Apoſtolicall precept: &amp; againe pag. 21. It is not by any expreſſe command from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, but by an ordinance of the church, as is the doctrine of many great diuines, and of our church in the booke of Homilies, that we ſanctify the Lords day, rather then any other day of the weeke, thus wrighteth M. Broade of the Lords day, and of its inſtitution, as being in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21142:27"/>the judgement of our owne church, not from God, nor from Chriſt, but from certaine Godly chriſtian, and well diſpoſed people.</p>
            <p>One obiection remaineth to be remoued, which is, That the Church of God hath kept this Lords day for a Sabbath many hundreds of yeeres; and can it be thought Gods whole church ſhould erre, and that ſo long?</p>
            <p>I anſwere, tis true indeed, we ought to hould a reuerent regard of the tenentes of our Mother the church, ſo as not lightely nor raſhely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any opinions which blemiſhe hir practiſe: Neuertheleſſe this we muſt know alſo, that the church whilſt on earth is liable to miſcariages through ignorance, for as much as God doth not reueale his whole truth to hir at once, but ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely now on thing, and then another, as ſhe is able to beare it, &amp; as the tymes may permite, and as it ſeemes good to his Godly pleaſure; doe we not ſee, daily light is brought into the church, and God reueales himſelfe more and more? and what doth this argue, but what we cannot deny, that is, that before ſuch light came, we were in darkenes and error, as touching thoſe pointes? yea we muſt grante the church may &amp; doth erre in ſome things vnles we will affirme that ſhee is growne to fulneſſe of ſtature, and perfection in knowledge, ſo as nothing more can be added: I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21142:27"/>verily perſwade my ſelfe theſe very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipts that the true Church of God cannot erre in any maine thing, is the very foundation of errour in thoſe mindes where ſuch conceipts rule: for vvhoe would be ſo idle to ſpend labour and tyme, to try all thinges: and with the Bereanes, to ſerch the Scriptures, if alredy our curch hath tryed all, and ſerched all to perfection, ſo as they haue no vvayes erred? more humble thoughts of our church doth better become vs: all that I aime at hereby is no more but this, that we alleage not the practiſe of our church as an infallible rule &amp; touch ſtone of truth, but though a Paul preacht it, yet with theſe Bareanes Act. 17.11. rather to ſerche the Scriptures then to rely vpon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of man.</p>
            <p>Finally, that our church hath kept this Lords day ſo longe; and therfore the more ſtrange it ſhould be an errour: I anſwere, tis true the Lords day hath beene kept for about this 1200. yeeres; as nere as I can gueſſe from about the yeere 364. at which tyme the Laodicean counſaile enacted a Law for the aboliſhing the Sabbath day, and for the ſole ſetting vp the Lords day: till then both dayes were in vſe, ſaue that as hath beene ſhowne the Lords day was ſometymes omitted: ſince then, only the Lords day hath beene in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and that is about a 1200. yeeres; but here it is to be noted, what church it is that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally

            <p>Firſt, as touching the ſubſtance of the Com: note, that as in a bonde you haue two eſſentiall things: thone, is the ſumme of mony to be paide; the other is the day when it is to be paide: and as in circumciſion there was two things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, the one vvas the acte of circumciſion; the other was the tyme and day when to be done that is, on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, Geneſ. 17.12. and as in that other Sacrament the paſſeouer, two things were commanded: the one was the ſlaying and eating of the paſſeouer; the other, was the tyme and day when to be done, that is, on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the month, Exod. 12.6.8.

Remember Saturday, to keepe it holy &amp;c. now that Sabbath day was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of one of their weeke dayes is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to all, ſince they counted all the other 6. dayes of the weeke by the Sabbath day; thus, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and laſt day of the weeke they called Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: the firſt day of the vveeke; our Sune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, they called the firſt of the Sabbath: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the weeke, our Moonday, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſeconde of the Sabbath: our Tewſday, the thirde of the Sabbath &amp;c. ſo as you ſee no day of the weeke was called Sabbath day, but this one only: I confeſſe the word Sabbath, ſignifieth a Reſt; but it alſo ſignifieth a proper name of the laſt day of their weeke. Secondly, if this be not enough to ſhew that God had ſett aparte one certaine well knowne day afore any of the other 6. dayes for Holy duties. Then marke what the Lord ſaith further in this Com: The Seaventh day is the Sabbath &amp;c. not the third day, nor the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, nor the firſt day of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21142:29"/>the weeke, but the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day is the Sabbath: where to take hence all ſcruples aboute the order of the day, it hath pleaſed God for our certaine infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to pointe directly and diſtinctly to the day which he wold haue kept, as by the finger, ſaying, The Seaventh day; Thouchinge which word of number Seaventh it is to be noted, that it is not a Cardinall number, but an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, notifying which for order: the propertie whereof is to denote, 1. one, and one only: 2. it notes that indiuiduall particular one, which for order is the laſt of that number: for inſtance, The Thirde: it is not any of the three, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, nor the firſt; but it is the laſt of the three: ſo the fifthe, it is not the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. nor the ſecond, but it is the laſt of the 5: ſo, the Seaventh day is the Sabbath; not the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, nor the third day, nor the firſt day of the weeke, but the laſt day of the weeke, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. is the Sabbath: ſo againe you ſee the Lord hath culled out the laſt day of the 7. for his Sabbath, and hath not lefte it indefinitly and vndetermined: Furthermore, left any ſhold thinke the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day may be ſeparated from that day called the Sabbath day, as is vſually thought; therefore note 1. the Lord God hath ioyned them together in his Comm. The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day is the Sabbath, ſee Levit: 23.3. and Exod: 35.2. Luk: 13.14. not the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. nor the firſt; now what God hath ioyned let noe man put aſunder. 2. Note,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21142:30"/>that theſe two; The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day: and the Sabbath day: they be vſed in holy Scripture promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, as both pointeing at the ſame very day and tyme, ſee Geneſ. 2.3. God bleſſed the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day and hallowed it &amp;c. the which Moſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateing againe Exod: 20.11. ſaith, The Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day and hallowed it: ſo as a man may ſay, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day is the Sabbath day: and the Sabbath day is the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day: take away one, and take avvay both; graunte one and graunt both: they are like the names Ieſus, and Chriſt: both which belonge to one perſon, our bleſſed Sauiour: or like to the names, Lords day; and firſt day of the weeke, both which belonge to our Sunday. Thirdly, the particularity of the tyme and day is apparantly pointed vnto in the reaſon of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm: which is fetcht from the day wherein God reſted, thus, That day which I the Lord ſanctified, the ſame day muſt thou ſanctifie: But the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day I the Lord ſanctified: Therfore the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day muſt thou ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie: novv ſince tis abſurde to thinke the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes ſhold ſpeake of one 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, and the concluſion of ſome other 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, therfore if vve can finde out what 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day it was God reſted on, vve may by it knovv vvhat day vve muſt reſt on; now tis moſt apparant that God reſted vpon the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day from the creation, which was that day which immediatly followed the ſix
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21142:30"/>dayes of creation. So then are vve to keepe by virtue of the Com: the ſame particular ſeaventh day which next followerh Gods and our ſix dayes labour.</p>
            <p>The vſe of this pointe is 1. to diſcouer the errour of our tymes, which vvill apply this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Com: to the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, or to the firſt day of the vveeke, which is appropriated to the ſeaventh day of the weeke by God the Lavvgiuer: or will applie it to the Lords day, which is the day after the Sabbath, vvhen the Com: is appropriate to the Sabbath day, vvhich is the day before the Lords day.</p>
            <p>Vſe 2. is for refutation of thoſe that ſay, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not ſo be vve giue God a day, which it is: ſo be vve giue God a Sabbath, or a 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, it matters not whither this or that day: Noe, ſay you it matters not which, vvhy then did God take ſuch care to decipher out the very day vvherein he vvold be ſerued, by thos 3. markes, 1. he telleth you tis the Sabbath day. 2. that tis the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day. 3. that tis that 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day whereon himſelfe reſted? Further, this vvere to make hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved things common, and common things hollowed; and to croſſe God, vvhoe therfore culled out the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day from the others, becauſe in it he had reſted, Geneſ. 2.3. Exod. 20.11. beſids the reaſon vvhy God hallovved the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, vvas becauſe in it he had reſted: which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21142:31"/>reaſon cannot be true of any day of the 7. ſaue the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. If God vvold require it at their hands that did not circumciſe one the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. daye, and eate the Paſſeouer one the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, the which tymes God did vvithout repetition once only in the ſame text mention, vvhat vvill he doe to vs to vvhome he hath deceiphred out that tyme by 3. ſuch notable markes, in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: it is noe dallying vvith God.</p>
            <p>Vſe 3. is for confutation of a common but frivolouſe anſvvere, ſaying. vvhen they be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to this particular ſett time of 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day from creation: the Com: ſpeakes not of The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: but of A Sabbath: by a Sabbath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any day indefinitly and vncertainly: &amp; thus they make Gods ſett and certaine tymes vncertaine and doubtfull, vvhich is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods minde, ſince God did limite and determine vvhich of the 7. dayes he vvould haue, by thoſe 3. notable markes aboue ſaide: vvhen the Lord ſaid, Remember the Sabbath day: the Ievves vvere not lefte at randome, as not knovving vvhich day of the 7.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21142:31"/>Remember The Sabbath day: not Remember A Sabbath day: finally, were it lawfull thus to wreſt Scripture, whereas the third Comm: is, Thou ſhalt not take The name of the Lord thy God in vaine &amp;c. might not I here cauile thus; Thou ſhalt not take A name of the Lord thy God in vaine; vnderſtanding by A name ſome Titles and Attributes of God vncertaine what, or which: or vnderſtanding by A name ſome name of God as then vnknowne, like as by A Sabbath, we wold haue our new Sabbath meant, which then to the Iewe at Mount Sinay was vtterly vnknowne? In a worde were this lawfull might not I in like ſorte delude them of the Lords day, for being the firſt day of the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke? and whereas S. Iohn ſaith Revel. 1.10. I was rauiſhed in the Spitit on The Lords day: I might ſay, on A Lords day; vnderſtanding it of any day of the weeke vncertaine which. Againe ſince neighther Chriſt, nor the 4. Euangeliſtes, nor any of the Apoſtles after Chriſts reſurrection, did euer alter the name Sabbath, from Saturday, ther for Saturday is ſtill the Sabbath day by name.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this vſe is likevviſe to be vrged by way of confutation to thoſe who wold haue it reade or vnderſtode not The Seauenth, but A Seauenth day, as of an vncertaine day; the whie is made certaine by God: for it is ſuch a ſeauenth day as is the laſt day of 7, or of the weeke: 2. tis

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:21142:32"/> 3. Thus hauing fonde out the particular time and day of Gods worſhip; before I can come to ſpeake of the duties to be performed in the day, we haue 4. more particulares to ſpeake of concerning the time: 1. to Remember this time 2. that it is called Sabbath: 3. that tis called a Day: 4. of the reaſon why God Sanctified this day afore any other: To handle theſe in order as they laye in the Comm.</p>
            <p>Remember &amp;c. here the Lord prefixeth a Memorandum to the ſeauenth day Sabbath: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath day &amp;c. a reaſon why God prefixeth a Remembrance to this Comm: is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by diuines, to be for preuention of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes and forgetfulneſſe one the 6. working dayes, of the Sabbath next enſuing; leaſt that men leaue ſome common workes of the 6. dayes to be done on the ſeauenth day Sabbath; this I confeſſe a truth indeed, but this is not all I ſuppoſe; for, if one demaundes a reaſon why God prefixeth a Memorandum to this Comm: more then to any other of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, that cannot be the reaſon, becauſe by not forethinking of the Sabbath, ſome vvorkes are left to be done on the Sabbath, and ſo the Sabbath is profaned, for ſince vve breake euery one of the Commandements, it ſhold a beene likevviſe nedfull to haue had a Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum prefixt to euery Comm: leſt through for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21142:32"/>&amp; vvant of forethinking vve breake them too; but ſince a Memora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dum is put to this and not too others, a reaſon wold be ſought, ſuch a one as agrees to this Com. and not to others: now if I may take leaue to deliuer mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I cannot finde out a better reaſon than this, God foreſeeing that after a longe time, that is about 364. yeeres after Chriſt, this his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath wold be not in part violated, but vtterly and altogether blotted out of remembrance in the Church for 1200 yeeres together, and ſo this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm: forgotten and not the other 9. or this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. aboue, or rather then the other 9. ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was a Memorandum ſet to this, and not to the other, or to this aboue the other, to bring men into the Remembrance and practiſe of it againe: I ſaid, this Sabbath was blotted out in the yeere of Chriſt 364. that is by the Laodicean Counſaile, as hereafter you ſhall heare &amp;c. from thence vntill this preſent howre it is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, for we profane it, buy, ſell, market, fayer, and worke in it, I pray God bring this to our remembrances and cloſe home to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: I ſaid alſo, this Comm: is forgotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the other 9. for thers no one thing in all the other 9. commanded that is wholly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together forgotten, as is this ſeauenth day; and though Papiſtes haue forgotten foulely, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Comm: yet bleſſed be God, the Reformed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21142:33"/>Church of Proteſtantes remember it well, but as for the ſeauenth day Sabbath, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vpon it, Remember the Sabbath day: this is forgotten at all hands vtterly by both Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes and Papiſtes: and ſo much of the word Remember.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next pointe to be conſidered is the name of this ſacred Time and day, tis called Sabbath: Remember the Sabbath &amp;c. In this name two thinges are conſiderable: 1. that it is vſed as a proper name for the ſeauenth and laſt day of the weeke with the Iewes; of this I ſay no more, referring you to what I haue elſe where afore, ſaid touching the Sabbath as a proper name &amp;c. 2. That the word Sabbath ſignifieth Reſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt vſe I will raiſe bence, ſhall be from the conſideration of both thoſe ioyned togeather, and may be for information, ſheweing that the Hebrew word Sabbath, may be tranſlated into Engliſhe wordes, if vve doe but ioyne theſe two together, that is, the proper name, and the ſignification of it: ſo for Sabbath, as tis a proper name of the laſt day of the weeke, put Saturday; and then hereto add that ſignification of the word Sabbath, Reſt: and then thus it may be rendred Saturday-Reſt: Remember Saturday-Reſte,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21142:33"/>to keepe it holy &amp;c. the profit that wold come of this is, that there vvold be no ſcruple in mindes of the ignorant, which day of the weeke it is that God requireth in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm: to be Sanctified. Further, it wold reforme the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch as call our firſt day of the vveeke, or Lords day, The Sabbath day: thus doeing they woefully confound thinges, as times and dayes: iuſt as if vve novv a dayes ſhold begine to call our Sunday by the name Saturday, what a confuſion wold this breede of time? tranſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing the proper name of the ſeauenth day of the weeke vnto the firſt day of the weeke: Hence in part is that deluſion of well minded ignorant people, that when they reade the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm: Remember the Sabbath day &amp;c. and then bethink themſelues that vve call our Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Sabbath day, ſurely then conclude they, our Sunday or Lords day is the day that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by this his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm: which is a groſſe errour, ſince vve all ſay the Sabbath day is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into that which we call the Lords day: and if the Sabbath day be changed (as is ſaid) into the Lords day why doe vve not put away the ould name, and take vp only the new name, like as the name of that Father of the faithfull, it was of ould Abram, but when God changed his name into Abraham; the Lord ſaid, neighther ſhall thy name be called any more Abram, but thy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21142:34"/>name ſhall be called Abraham Geneſi 17.5. and ſo let vs no more calle it Sabbath day, but Lords day: But if you will retaine the proper name Sabb. ſtill, as is not vnmeete you ſhould, ſince it is a name that may perpetually be kept in the Church, it being a particle of the Morall Law, which is perpetuall, why then I beſeech you, let euery day haue its owne proper name, doe not miſcall dayes by wronge names: Let our Satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day be called Sabbath day, for ſo it of all the dayes in the weeke anſweres to the Iewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; vvitneſſe the Iewes, when they liued in England, they kept Saturday for theire Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and as they doe likewiſe in other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the World, where they live at this day: and witneſſe the Lattines, vvho to this day call Saturday, Sabbath day, Dies Sabbathi: I doubt not but this exhortation might preuaile, were it not for an inconuenience, which wold be this then, that if vve called Saturday, Sabbath day, then our people wold growe to thinke that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday ſhold be Sanctified by Gods will in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm. for our Sabbath day: and if vve call the firſt day of the weeke Sunday, or Lords day only, then the people vvold not ſo eaſily be made beleeue, that the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm. bindes them to the Lords day, becauſe the Comm. binds only to the day, called Sabbath day, not ſpeaking one vvord of the day called Lords day: But if vve
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21142:34"/>call the Lords day, Sabbath day once, then it goes downe the ſtomacke without any lett or ſcruple, that the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Comm: pointes directly to our firſt day of the weeke, or Lords day, and ſo a wrong day is kept, one day being taken for another, &amp; ſo Superſtition is vſed for Religion, and one day God ſhall ſay, who required this at your handes? who may the people ſay? why our watch men, our miniſters taught vs ſo, and called it ſo, and told vs it ought to be ſo, as for vs, we were not learned in the tounges and Artes, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue our Miniſters: The Prieſts lippes muſt preſerue knowledge, and we muſt aſke the Law at theire mouthes: but this plea cannot alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather free the people ſee Ezek: 33.6. nor can the Miniſtrie be altogether free of a ſhrewde taxatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (were it not hitherto done of ignorance and of a good intente) in aſmuch as they are guilty of this tranſgreſſion, partly by miſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meing of dayes, which cauſeth an errour in the people.</p>
            <p>But hereto it will be ſaid Sabbath, ſignifies a Reſt: now on our Lords day we Reſt; and therfore we may call it a Sabbath day: I anſwer, tis true Sabbath ſignifieth Reſt, &amp; ſo the Lords day might be called Sabbath day, but yet in no other ſenſe then euery common Holy day, wherein we worke not, may be called Sabbath day, that is, Reſteing day: now if the nameing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21142:35"/>of Holy dayes, Sabbath dayes, ſhold beget an inclination in the ignorant to ſanctifie them as Sabbaths? were it not time to forbeare ſuch names? Furthermore note, that we may call the Lords day, or firſt day of the weeke, and other common Holy dayes, Reſting dayes, but we muſt know with all that thus to call and to name them, is meerly humane, and of our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe; for God neuer named or called the Lords day, nor common holy dayes, Reſteing dayes; if therfore we will call dayes, as God calleth them, then muſt vve call only the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, or Reſting day, for ſaid God Exod. 20.10. The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, is the Sabbath, or Reſting day. I anſwere 2. Sabbath day may be vſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: or not in any reference vnto it: if it be vſed not in reference to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: I am not againſt it, for ſo may we call Chriſtmas day when tis one a weeke day, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and ſo may we call dayes of publike thankſgiuing and reioycing Sabbath dayes, as coronation dayes, &amp; Gunpowder Treaſon dayes &amp;c. but if vve call any day Sabbath day, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, in relation to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: as in that ſenſe we call our Lords day Sabbath day, then know, it cannot be called Sabbath day, for that this name Sabbath day in reference to 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: it muſt haue theſe properties, 1. it muſt be ſet vpon its proper day, our Saturday, the which is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21142:35"/>named by God Sabbath day, or Reſting day: 2. it muſt be the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day from the creation, or laſt day of the vveeke. 3. it muſt be the day which God bleſſed and ſanctified Geneſ. 2.3. Exod. 20.11. now none of theſe thinges agree to our Lords day.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The next point to be treated one is the vvord Day, Remember the Sabbath day: now as before vve haue heard of the Sabbath day, vvhich it is for order and place, as vvhither the firſt, or 2d &amp;c. or 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day. ſo now vve are to heare of the duration and length of that Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day. A day is commonly diuided into a day naturall of 24. howres, or artificiall of 12. how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; but I muſt craue leaue to departe from this diſtinction though a common receiued one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe how euer it may haue its vſe in ciuill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, yet is it not Canonicall and Diuine, and therfore not to be a rule in expounding the word Day in Scripture: that I may not ſeeme ſleightily to deny a common diſtinction, note the reaſons moueing me here too are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is no vvhere founde in Scripture that they had any day of 24. howres; a day of 12. howres I reade of I confeſſe, but I neuer reade of a day of 24. howres; it is not ſafe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Day in 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: to interpret it of a day of 24. howres.</p>

By a day naturall of 24. howres vve vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand both the light and the darkneſſe, the day and the night vvhich fale within compaſſe of theſe 24. howres; novv I pray what a woefull confuſion and jumbling of things together is here? vvhat is this but to put light for darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vvhen ye call the night or darkneſſe, Day? &amp; may you not as vvell put darkneſſe for light, and call the day or light, Nighte? may vve not as vvell comprize Hell, vnder the vvord Heauen; as darkenes vnder the vvord Day? vnles it be Ironically, I thinke this is matchleſſe.</p>
            <p>But hereto it will be ſaid, doth not Scripture thus? Geneſ. 1.5. So the Euening and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vvere the firſt day? by Euening here is meante the night, and by morning the day or light, and both theſe made vp the firſt day.

            <p>Hauing thus giuen my reaſons why I reiect a day naturall, of 24. howres, conſiſting of day and night both; In next place I am to ſhewe vvhat I meane by Day in 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: By Day I vnderſtand the tyme of light only, namly all that ſpace of tyme and light from day peepe or day breake in the morning, vntill day be quite off the ſkye at night: that by Day is meante the light, ſee Gene. 1.5.

The artificiall day is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly of the ſame lenght, 12. howres long: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, by Day in 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: I rather thinke the the naturall day to be meante, then the artificiall day, for it is the ſafeſt to giue God the longer of the two, that is the day from day breake, to laſt ſhutting in of the day, ſo long as is any light in the ſkye.</p>
            <p>Here a caſe of conſcience would be diſcuſſed, that is, if our Sabbath be but from day breake to ſhutting vp of day, hovv ſhall vve doe in depth of vvinter, at vvhat tyme vve haue not 12. howres of day light? novv your opinion vvas euen novv that it is the ſafeſt to giue God the longer of the two dayes, rather the naturall than the artificiall, but in depth of vvinter the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall day of 12. howres is the longer day: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere 1. though for that tyme the artificiall day be longer than the naturall day, yet it is ſo but for a little vvhile during the depth of the winter only, vvhich tyme excepted, all the yeere after the naturall day is the longer, and ſo theſe 2. dayes compared together in all tymes, vve giue God the longer day vvhen vve giue him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall day. 2. For ſo much as it is not likely that God would haue vs meaſure him his day by two diuers metevvands, that is by the day naturall at one tyme of the yeere, and by the day artificiall at an other tyme, therfore I thinke it the more
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21142:37"/>likely that we are tyed only to the day naturall in Winter, though it be ſhorter then, then the other: Neuertheles, becauſe the ſafeſt vvay is beſt, and an errour on the right hand rather to be admitted then one the lefte, if any man judge it better, for the depth of vvinter, to keepe his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath by the artificiall day, I ſay not to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yea, I ſay for myne owne particular, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to accompany him whoeſouer he be, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Sabbath dayes exerciſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayning all ſeruile laboures, not onely for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall day, but after it is ended, vntill it be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to goe to reſt &amp; ſleepe.</p>
            <p>Here an other queſtion ariſeth, if we be tyed but to the day tyme and light onely for our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, vvhat then ſhall become of the tyme of night, before or after the Sabbath? I anſwere, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth that God hath made the night for man to reſt in and ſleepe, and ſo neceſſarily he that tyme reſteth from all labours, as in the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day tyme: but you may ſay againe what and if a man be not diſpoſed to ſleepe, as not to goe to bedd ſo ſoone as the artificiall day in depth of Winter be done, may he ſet vpon the duties of his ordenary calling vntill he goe to reſt? here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too I anſwere, where God hath left no order what to doe as in this caſe, here then it is left to Chriſtian diſcretion; In this caſe then I ſhould judge it very behoofefull that we deale vvith
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21142:38"/>God in this night, as vve doe by our ſelues on other nightes of the 6. working dayes, in theſe, if we be not diſpoſed to goe to bedd, vve vvill ſpend that parte of the night vve pleaſe to ſett vp in, in the vvorkes of the day before, ſo let vs be as mindfull of our ſoules as of our bodies, &amp; on the Sabbath night if vve pleaſe to riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, let that parte of the night be ſpent in a holy preparation to the duties of the day follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, to ſet forwards them; if we pleaſe to ſett vp after the day light be ſpent, then againe let this parte of the night be ſpent ſutable to the day before, in reading, conference, meditation, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Pſalmes, and Prayer; To this may I fitly apply that of Holy Dauid who ſpent much of the night in prayer and praiſes, Pſ. 42.8. The Lord will graunte his louing kindnes in the day, and in the night ſhall I ſing of him &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The firſt vſe of this point may be for confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an errour of ſome diuines, houlding the Sabbath doth begine ouer night, on Saturday at night, or on Saturday Euening: If God enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth only the day; Remember the Sabbath day &amp;c. by what authoritie can any ſay, we be bound to ſanctify more then a day, as namly to ſanctify the Sabbath day, and alſo a parte of the day, or night goeing before the Sabbath day?</p>
            <p>I know well the end theſe diuines aime at is holy and good, and their argumentes carry a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21142:38"/>ſtrong ſhew of truth yet not ſtrong enough me thinketh, the beſt that I could ere meete withall are theſe 3. the formoſt Taken from Geneſ. 1.5. The euening &amp; the morning were the firſt day: where by Euening, they vnderſtand the Night from about after Sune ſet forwards; by morning, all the day after; now hence they thus argue, That looke as God made the day at creation, ſo we muſt after keepe it: But God made the day to begine at Euening, Ergo &amp;c. I anſwere, the grownd of this argument is from a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but miſe vnderſtanding of that text, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ. 1.5. as I haue formerly ſhowne, ſo I deny that by Euening, in the Text is meant an Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which begines the night and compriſes the night in it, as the argument vnderſtands it; for by Euening is meante only the afternoone till Sune ſett, as formerly I haue ſhowne: but againſt this it may be ſaid, this ſenſe is to make God to ſpeake of things miſe orderly, if by euening you vnderſtand the afternoone, and by morning the forenoone, then tis as if God had ſaid, So the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone and the forenoone vvere the firſt day, whereas it had beene more orderly to a ſaid, So the forenoone and the afternoone were the firſt day: ſince the forenoone is in order before the afternoone. I anſwere ſuch liberty though God doth take in ſpeeche, for inſtance, to goe no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an example, ſee Geneſ. 1.2.3.4.5. dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21142:39"/>was for order before light; and yet in v. 4.5. God mentiones the light before the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and why not then, the after noone before the forenoone?</p>
            <p>Their 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> argument is taken from Levit. 23.32. from Euene to Euene ſhall ye celebrate your Sabbath. Hereto I anſwere this a peculiar law to the ceremoniall Sabbathes annually, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the morall Sabbath weekly, now we muſt not drawe the law of ceremoniall Sabbaths vpon the morall Sabbath, for then muſt the morall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath on 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, be annualy onely; and on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the month; as Leuit. 23.27. without regard to the day of the weeke: beſides many other differences twixt the morall and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Sabbaths that might be ſhowne; but cheifly note in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: is but one day only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to wit the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day but in Leui. 23. is two diſtinct dayes commanded to wit the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, v. 27. and the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day apart of it, v. 32. now would any inferre hence, that we ſhould giue God the Sabbath day, and a parte alſo of the day, goeing next before it, euery weeke? vvere not this to giue God more then one day, when in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: he required but one day?</p>
            <p>A 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to enforce the begining of the Sabbath on the Euening, is taken from Mark. 15.42. It was the day of the preparation, that is before the Sabbath; whence it is gathered by many, that the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21142:39"/>Jewes vſed on the Euening before the Sabbath, to haue a preparation to the Sabbath, by ſetting a parte that euening for holy exerciſes, refraying ordenary workes, as they did on the Sabbath: where vnto I anſwere, more is gathered out this text then it vvill afforde; and that preparation vvhich was proper to a ceremoniall Sabbath, is applied to our Morall Sabbath: To this purpoſe it muſt be obſerued, that at this tyme of Chriſts paſſion, and on that day whereon he lay in the graue; our Saturday, there fell out two Sabbaths, a morall and a ceremoniall vpon that day, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, Piſcator, and others affirme, and as euery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowes; and as muſt needes be, for our Saturday wherein Chriſt lay in the graue vvas Jewes Sabbath day, of the 4th Comm: ſo there is one: now againe the day before this, namly good friday, was the day the Iewes kept for their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouer day Ioh. 18.28. Ioh. 19.14. now the Law of the paſſeouer was, that the paſſeouer ſhould be killed and eaten on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the month Leuit. 23.5. and on the next day, the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the month they had an holy conuocation and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wherein they did no ſeruile labour v. 6.7. and this was a Sabbath day, to wit a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Sabbath day: now the Iewes killing their paſſeouer on good friday, as the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, then Saturday, muſt be the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, and ſo an holy convocation and Sabbath by the Leuiticall Law:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21142:40"/>and ſo here is an other Sabbath fell on and with the weekly Sabbath: now to come to the point, the paraſcue or preparation ſpoken of Mark. 15.42. hath reſpect of theſe two Sabbathes, only to this latter, that is to the Ceremoniall Sabbath, which was on the firſt day of vnleauened bread, or on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the month, and it hath not reſpect vnto the Morall Sabbath: now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mouing me to ſay ſo are, 1. becauſe this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſcue or preparation is not any vvhere applied to the Morall Sabbath, but only it ſtands in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ceremoniall, and therfore we reade the Euangeliſt Ioh. 19.14. calling it the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paſſeouer, not the preparation to the Sabbath, as they would. 2. we reade of a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration euer on the day before the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the month, the Sabbath on the firſt day of vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread, but of none before the vveekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ſee Luk. 22.8.9. and ye know there muſt be a preparation of the paſſeouer before it be eaten, for it muſt be killed, and roſted firſt, Exod. 12.6.8. and a place where it muſt be eaten in muſt be prepared too, Luk. 22.11. and to winde vp all in a word, the paraſcue or preparation whereof Scripture ſpeakes ſo oft; is nothing elſe but the preparation and making ready of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouer to be eaten, the which labour fell as now vpon the day before the Sabbath, vnderſtand whither Sabbath you will Mark. 15.42. ſo then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21142:40"/>this preparation ouer night, being proper to the Ceremoniall Sabbath of the paſſeouer, it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to the weekly Sabbath, &amp; ſo the weekly Sabbath began not ouer night ere the more for this Text, Mark. 15.42.</p>
            <p>Finally, the cleering of this text Mark. 15.42. by the way may be vſefull, to ſhew their opinion is growndleſſe, vvho vrge a preparation to the Sabbath on Saturday afternoone: or, on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day euen, preſſing vs then to refraine our weekly labours, and to ſpend that portion of tyme in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes: for my part I know no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the Sabbath to be performed more on Saturday after noone, than in the forenoone, or then on Friday or Thurſday before; that is, I know none but this, that we ſhould remember it afore hand, and ſo to be more and more mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of it, as it drawes nerer and nerer vnto vs, leſt vvhen tis come we profane it.</p>
            <p>You haue heard the firſt vſe, ſhewing vvhen the Sabbath doth not begine, as namly, not ouer night &amp;c. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> vſe ſhall be to ſhew by vvay of inſtruction vvhen the Sabbath doth begine: The Sabbath is to begin in the morning, vvhen the day begines, as breake of day; this flowes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally from the Comm: for if God commanded vs to keepe holy the Day, then muſt we begine vvith the day, then vvhen the day begines: to begin it afore the day, as at midnight, or the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21142:41"/>like, is growndleſſe, and is more then God euer required: ſo, to delay the beginning an howre, 2. or 3. after day breake, is to robbe God of a part of his day, by ſanctifying to the Lord not a day, but a peece of a day.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and laſt point in the Comm: as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching tyme and day, is to enquire 1. vvhat day God ſanctified, but this nedeth no labour, ſince tis apparant God ſanctified the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, and laſt day of the vveeke, that day vvhich followed his 6. dayes vvorke. 2. vve are to enquire after the reaſon mouing God to ſanctify this day of the vveeke before any other; and this is plainly laid downe in the laſt clauſe of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: and againe in Geneſ. 2.3. So God pleſſed the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day and ſanctified it. Becauſe that in it he had reſted from all his vvork: vvhere you ſee God renders the ſpeciall reaſon mouing him to bleſſe and to ſanctify the Sabbath day; and it vvas, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that on that day himſelfe had reſted.</p>
            <p>Uſe 1. may be to ſhew vs that God in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: enioyneth not a day at randome, but a particular day, ſuch a day as hath this reaſon, of Gods Reſt; belonging to it; now this belonged only to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the vveeke; not to the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, nor to the firſt day of the vveeke, our Lords day, for God the creatour reſted not vpon our Lords day, vvhen he had finiſhed the vvorke of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21142:41"/>creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but vpon our Saturday the 7th day which goeth next before the Lords day.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. may be to ſhevv vs, that the 4th Com: can not be vrged or applied to the firſt day of the vveeke, our Lords day; becauſe that reaſon of Gods Reſt, vpon the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, vvhich moued him to ſanctify, it neither doth nor can belong to the Lords day: now ſince that reaſon of Gods Reſt, vvhich is a parte of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: can not belong to our Lords day, no more can the whole Com: belonge vnto it.</p>
            <p>Uſe 3. and me thinks the reaſon of Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſhould ſay ſome thing for the morality and perpetuity of the Sabbath, for as ſine moued God to bringe death into the vvorld at the firſt vpon Adam Rom. 5.12. ſo the ſame continuing, moues God ſtill to continue death in the world vpon Adams poſterity: So Gods Reſt vpon the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day mouing him at firſt to ſanctify it, the ſame reaſon remayning to vvorlds end, ſhould moue God to continue the ſanctification of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day for euer; the ground of which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is taken from that axiome, That God is immutable and vnchangable &amp; euer the ſame, ſo as if things be the ſame towards him, he againe is the ſame towards them: Hence it is vve thus argue, did God ſo to Abraham, to David, to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh &amp;c. if thou be to God as they were, ſo God vvill be to thee, as he vvas to them: now as God
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21142:42"/>is euer the ſame, ſo is Gods reſt on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day.</p>
            <p>And ſo we haue ſpake of the duty of the day, and of the tyme; next we ſhould come to ſpeake of the duties in the day, and in the tyme: the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the day are 2. Holines, and Reſt: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to keepe the Sabbath day Holy: and in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke: but as touching expoſition of theſe two, Holines and Reſt, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deſiſte for aſmuch as vve differ not in theſe, ſauing about the latter, that it is houlden partly morall, partly ceremoniall, but of that by and by.</p>
            <p>Hauing ſpoken of the duty of the day; and mentioned the duties in the day: here a queſtion would be ſcanned touching both theſe compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuly, to know whither is the more excellent &amp; that which God did firſt and principally aime at, the duty of the day, or the duties in the day? a queſtion at firſt ſight I confeſſe it ſeemes friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe; the rather I moue it, becauſe I heare the moſt ſo ſleighting this ſacred tyme, as but a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance &amp;c. and as a thing not required of it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe, as are the duties in this tyme Holineſſe and Reſt, but only for an other things ſake, as for the Holineſſe ſake, that is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this tyme, and ſo as if the Holineſſe be performed, it ſkilleth not ſo much for the tyme.</p>
            <p>For my parte therfore I cannot ſee, but the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21142:42"/>tyme of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day is more excellent then be the duties of Holineſſe and Reſt, in the tyme; if theſe duties be not conſidered abſolutly and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, but reſpectiuly as ſubſeruient to the tyme. Holineſſe, conſider of it only as a dutie of firſt Table, in this branch of praiſing and lauding God, in an acknowledgment of his power, and wiſedome, and goodneſſe &amp;c. ſo reflecting Gods holy workes and attributes vpon himſelfe: now conſider, as the Heauens declare the glory of God Pſ. 19.1. So thinke on that 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, as the Prophet Dauid ſpeakes of dayes in generall v. 2. Day vnto day vttereth, the ſame too: or Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Day, as Aynſworth obſerueth: ſo then if dayes doe vtter the glory of God, and ſhew forth his handy vvorkes, reflecting vnto God, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame to men, then doubtleſſe the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath hath a kinde of ſecret ſpeech vnto and praiſe of God, by reflection vnto God, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration vnto man, the whole worke of creation done vpon the 6. dayes before, ſhewing forth theſe Attributes of Gods wiſedome, power, and goodneſſe, manifeſted in thoſe dayes: and ſurely this day doth more compleatly in its kinde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect and giue God the full glory of his worke of creation then can any man, vvho becauſe he knowes things by halues can ſpeake of them but by peeces: well, ther is ſome thing in this, though I vvill not be curious nor ſtand vpon it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:21142:43"/> 2. As for Holineſſe, as prayer, prayſes, and the like, I conſider of it abſolutly, or relatiuly: Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly without reference to any ſpeciall tyme, as a parte of Gods worſhip and ſeruice, and ſo I graunt it may be greater then the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day tyme: relatiuly, as tis employed to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it withall, and thus it is not ſo great nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. I explaine my ſelfe by this ſimile, a ſonne hath a booke of his deceaſed father, for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſake he is ſo in loue with the booke, as he will put vpon it ſiluer ot goulden claſpes, ſilkin ſtrings, double gild it, &amp; other coſt to the double or treble value of the book, if now you demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, whither the booke or the coſt, be the more excellent; why, ſure the coſt is the greater in it ſelfe conſidered, and not as made ſeruiceable to the booke, but the booke is the greater and more excellent in that for the bookes ſake, he begil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it and puts on all that coſt: So, as this Sonne gildeth and bewtifieth the booke, becauſe it was his fathers; juſt ſo, the Lord God bleſſed and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, becauſe that in it he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, Geneſ. 2.3. Exod. 20.11. The reaſon then mouing God to adorne and bewtify the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day ſo with Holines and Reſt, was becauſe God had once reſted on that day; ſo as the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day was not ſet apart for holineſſe ſake, but holineſſe at this tyme was appointed for the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> dayes ſake. Euen as Angles are miniſtering Spirites for our ſakes,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21142:43"/>and ſo are inferiour to men in ſome reſpects, that is, as they be attendants to vs: yet further, to this end ſee the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: where in the firſt place the Sabbath is commanded, Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: and as the cheif thing aimed at, it is twice mentioned, vvhereas Holines is but once named: yea, doth not the very order of the words and manner of vttering them importe the ſame? like as if one ſhould ſay to his ſeruant, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſuch a booke, that you ſaue it, and lay it vp carefully; or, that you gilde it and bewtifye it with the fineſt gould &amp;c. would not a man think by theſe words that all the ſeruants care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and coſt about the booke, were for the booke, and leſſe than the booke in worth and excellency? why iuſt in ſuch frame of words the Lord deliured the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: Remember the Sabbath day, that you ſanctify it, the which ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the day, is the adorning and the bewti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it.</p>
            <p>I conclude, if any man of better judgement think that ſo much is not to be attributed to the day and tyme as theſe my words importe, yet I thinke theſe things conſidered, he vvill judge there is much more in the tyme, &amp; that by Gods ordinance, then is commonly thought on, and ſo as euery ſleightie probable argument, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe diſtinction ſhould not force a man to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this ſacred Day, and prophane this tyme;

               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, that the Iewe might not on the Sabbath goe forth, or take a iourney any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

In it thou ſhalt not doe any work: which though it according to the letter forbiddeth generally any kind of worke whatſoeuer, yet they doe well expounde it to be vnderſtood only of ſeruile works forbidden, not of works of charity and neceſſity: But in this Text Exod. 35.3. ye ſhall kindle no fyer; this canſt needes be vnderſtood litterally and generally, as if the Iewe might in no caſe kindle any fyer, without exception: I pray what differeth the Law Exod. 20.10. Thou ſhalt not doe any worke: from the Law here, Exod. 35.3.

And againe, if you by this text of Col. 2.16. doe aboliſh the very duties of the Sabbath, Reſt, and Holines, as you doe, haue you not made faire worke think you, by aboliſhing that which you call the morality of the Sabbath, euer Reſt, and Holineſſe.</p>

               <p> I confeſſe, I heare them produce one Text to proue that all ſignes be aboliſht, and that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Coloſ. 2.16.17. vvhere the Apoſtle ſeemes to giue a reaſon vvhy meates and drinkes, and Holy dayes, &amp; Sabbath dayes are aboliſht, namly becauſe they were ſhaddowes of things to come; vvhence they collect that all ſhaddowes be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht; and all ſignes be ſhadowes; ergo all ſignes be aboliſht. Here vnto I anſwere 1. tis true that it is commonly taken that theſe things being ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, vvere therfore aboliſht; but vvhither this be a neceſſary, or but a contingent truth, I vvill not novv queſtion. 2. Whereas they ſuppoſe all ſignes to be ſhadowes, this is falſe: for, the word ſhadowe, being but thrice (as I take it) vſed in the New Teſtament, as in this Text Col. 2.17. and Heb. 8.5. and Heb. 10.1. vvith reference to Chriſt; it euer ſignifieth a ſhadow of things to come: now a ſigne is vſed to ſignifie, and ſigne out ſome tyme a thing paſt, as Rom. 4.11. ſome tyme a thing preſent, as Exod. 31.13. ſome tyme a thing future, as Geneſ. 17.8.11. now all ſignes then be not ſhadowes, ſince ſome ſignifie things paſt, ſome typifie things preſent. 2. Shadowes, ſtill hane reference to Chriſt, Col. 2.17. vvhich are a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt, ſo a ſhadow aimes at Chriſt: but a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne often hath reference to God to Jehouah, as in Exod. 31.13. Iſa. 38.7. Thus as a ſhadow and a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21142:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſigne differ in vvordes, ſo you ſee they differ in vſe and application, &amp; therfore they be not both one, as they vvould.</p>
               <p>But when they ſee this profe thus vvill not hould, then they fetch about the buſhe an other vvay, laboring to make the vvord ſigne in Exod. 31.13. to be a ſigne of a thing future, and that of Chriſt too; and then they thinke this done, the word ſigne in this text, and the vvord ſhadow in Col. 2.17. vvill be both one, and ſo their propoſe become good againe: To this end, they add theſe vvords, (By and through Chriſt) to the Text Exod. 31.13. and vnderſtand the text as if thus reade, The Sabbath is a ſigne &amp;c. that I the Lord doe ſanctifie you; by and through Chriſt: and the reaſon of this addition, they ſay is becauſe God doth all that he doth to his Church, by and through Chriſt, as in Eph. 1.3. Bleſſed be God, vvho hath bleſſed vs vvith all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Hereto I anſwere 1. admit that God did ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify, by and through Chriſt: how vvill it followe and be ſoundly proued, that becauſe God and Chriſt doe ſanctify man together, that therfore alſo vvhat God made to be a ſigne of his vvork of ſanctification, the ſame alſo muſt neceſſarily be a ſigne of Chriſts work of ſanctification? proue I ſay that it vvas Gods pleaſure to make the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath here a ſigne of Chriſt, as vvell as a ſigne of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21142:59"/>himſelfe: for though it vvas a ſigne by Chriſt, yet vvas it a ſigne of Chriſt: we muſt know ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are not applied to God or Chriſt naturally, but voluntarily, euen according as it pleaſed the Author of thoſe ſignes to appointe them, to one or more perſons, to himſelfe or to other.</p>
               <p>I anſwere 2. if Chriſts coworking vvith God, cauſeth that vvhich is a ſigne of Chriſt; Then it followes too, that the Miniſters of the Goſpell, coeworking vvith God and Chriſt in the worke of ſanctification, that therfore if the Sabbath be a ſigne that God ſanctifieth his people, the Sabbath muſt be a ſigne alſo, that vve of the Miniſtry doe ſanctify Gods people, and ſuch an vſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath vvas neuer heard of before.</p>
               <p>I anſwere 3. if they vvill conioyne any of the perſones in the Trinity, vvith the vvork of God the Father in ſanctifying vs, it vvere moſt proper to ioyne the Holy Ghoſt (and ſo Piſcator vpon Ezek. 20.12.20. applieth it) and ſay, God ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth vs by the Holy Ghoſt, rather than by Chriſt ſince ſanctification is more properly attributed to the Holy Ghoſt than to Chriſt: for the Father createth, the Sonne redemeth, the Holy Ghoſt ſanctifieth: But I will not ſtand vpon this.</p>
               <p>I come to the Text Eph. 1.3. God hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt: if you vnderſtand theſe vvordes ſo, as if vvhatſoeuer bleſſing the Church enioyeth, Chriſt doth equally

Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is an acte ſolely of God the Father, not of God the Redeemer, abſoluing and acquiting a penitent beleeuing ſinner: likewiſe Election is an acte of God the Father, not of Chriſt the Re-Redeemer: Alſo the donation of the elect vnto Chriſt Joh. 6.37. is of like nature: can it be ſaid here, God the Father gaue the elect vnto Chriſt, in Chriſt, by Chriſt, or through Chriſt? vvhereby you ſee Chriſt is ſo farre from effecting equally and a like all vvorkes vvith the Father, that ſome vvorkes he hath no hand or ſtroke in; and yet if they vvill haue this text to make for them, they muſt proue by it, that not only Chriſt doth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all vvorkes the vvhich his Father effecteth, but alſo that Chriſt doth them, euery way equally and a like as God the Father doth them; for, elſe how vvill it follow by like reaſon, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath being a ſigne of Gods ſanctification, it muſt alſo be a ſigne of Chriſts ſanctification too, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be from this grownd, that God his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Chriſt his ſanctification be both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed equally, and a like in all reſpectes? but ſince the former cannot be proued, the latter can much leſſe be proued: But there vnto it may be ſaid, though the generall cannot be proued, yet

God ſanctifyeth by virtue of his Godhead and Diuinity; Chriſt ſanctifyeth by the offering of his body Heb. 10.10. now great is the difference twixt the Deity and the Humanity. 2. God the Father ſanctifyeth vs of himſelfe, &amp; by himſelfe originally; but Chriſt his death and ſufferings,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21142:60"/>or Chriſt his body offred vp, ſanctifyeth not of and by it ſelfe, but of; from, and by God, and by his bleſſing vpon it: ſo you ſee there is not ſo ſtrong reaſon that Chriſt ſhould haue the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath made a ſigne of his worke, as there is that God ſhould haue it made a ſigne of his: and ſo much of his anſwere, wherein you ſee they put me to much nedleſſe buſines, by ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues too to buſy with humane reaſon, for as by bare force of reaſon without any precept they vvill erect and vphould new Sabbathes, as the Lords day; ſo by meere force of their reaſon they vvill make new ſignes, or elſe will make thoſe ſignes, to appertaine to ſuch perſons (as to Chriſt) newly, the which Gods word is deeply ſilent in, I can but wonder that diſcreete men who woll know the defects in our reaſon, dare there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wade into the deepes of God, thus farre: yea, I vvonder the more, when I conſider the ende thereof, which is to defeate God of his choſen ſacred tyme for his worſhip, and to thwarte a morall precept.</p>
               <p>I anſwere 5. admite that God doth all by Chriſt, and ſo euer did, and alſo admit the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath vvas a ſigne of Chriſts ſanctification, no leſſe then of Gods, yet though I may truely and ſoundly diſtinguiſh of Chriſts workes and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: ſome are euer preſent with the ſigne, ſome are future, whoſe ſigne goeth long before

That I the Lord doe ſanctify you: where the ſigne and the thing ſignified are together: of Chriſts futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſanctification, you haue the Sacraments of the ould Teſtament circumciſion and the Paſſeouer and alſo as they would thoſe meates &amp; drinkes, and Holy dayes, and Sabbath dayes, vvhich are a ſhaddow or ſigne of things to come, Col. 2.16.17. vvhere the ſignes and things ſignifyed are farre diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in tyme, &amp; tone long before thother: Note farther, Chriſt may be ſaid to ſanctify vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, or really; as I may ſay virtually, and as thus he is the lambe ſlaine from the begining of the world, the virtue of whoſe death did ſaue the Patriarkes, ſo the virtue of Chriſts incarnate may be ſaid euer to ſanctifye, as in dayes of Moſes Exod. 31.13. and thus although I grante Chriſt did ſanctify with God Exod. 31.13. and that (perhaps) alſo the Sabbath was a ſigne that Chriſt did then ſanctify the people, yet this ſigne being preſent with the thing ſignifyed, could not be aboliſht by the preſence of the body or thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed, for if it could then had the Sabbath beene aboliſht euen in Moſes dayes when he wrote thos wordes, Exod. 31.13. ſince the Sabbath vvhich was the ſigne and ſanctification, which was the the thing ſignifyed, were then both together
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21142:61"/>preſent. 2. Chriſt may be ſaid to ſanctify really, and that is whilſt he was God man, Incarnate, &amp; thus he is conſidered of only as to come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as Col. 2.27. which are a ſhadow of things to come, that is of Chriſt to come then; and here I deny not but ſignes of things to come may be abrogate, but, yet here I deny that the Sabbath Exod. 31.13. was made any ſigne of any thing to come afterwards; So then vntill they proue the Sabbath Exod. 31.13. was accounted and called by God a ſigne to come, of Chriſts ſanctification, they cannot proue it aboliſht: The Text ſaith not, The Sabbath ſhall be a ſigne &amp;c. that I the Lord will hereafter ſanctifie thee: but it ſaith, The Sabbath is a ſigne &amp;c. that I the Lord doe ſanctifie thee: now we muſt not confound ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, the preſent tenſe with the future tenſe, and ſo ouerthrow Grammar.</p>
               <p>I anſwer 6. and laſtly, I haue cauſe to reiect that which is their ſumme and ſcope out of this text Exod. 31.13. namly to proue this concluſion and aſſertion, That the Sabbath day is not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht: it being brought in direct oppoſition to Gods commandement Exod. 35.2.

               <p>The firſt is taken from Chriſt himſelfe: Say ſome men, vvhy Chriſt himſelfe aboliſhed the Sabbath day, and that euen in his owne tyme whilſt he vvas vpon the earth, for, He gaue leaue to vvork vpon the Sabbath; as to leade beaſtes

               <p>Hereto I anſwer 1. what matters it, what thoſe ſuperſtitious Phariſes cenſured of Chriſt, vvho were the blind leaders of the blinde, and of enuy could not endure Chriſt ſhould doe any thing but they would carpe and cauill at it if poſſiblie they could: though here they would not endure Chriſt ſo much as to cure a blinde man on the Sabbath, yet it appeareth it was but enuy &amp; but ſuperſtition in them, for Chriſt approued his owne facte of healing on the Sabbath day, by a common practiſe among the Jewes themſelues at that day, of the like ſaying: what man among you, if his ſheepe fall on the Sabbath, into a pitt, doth not take it, and lift it out? Mat. 12.10.11. yea it appeareth the Phariſes and Doctoures of the Law, euen vnder the Law, allowed other men (though not Chriſt, nor his Diſciples) to doe works of charity and neceſſity on the Sabbath, as to lift a ſheep out of the ditch: and for the Prieſt to kill the Sacrifices on the Sabbath, Matt. 12.5.11. I anſwere 2. let not vs attend to the Scribes and Phariſes cenſures, but hearken we to Chriſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21142:65"/>the true expounder &amp; obſeruer of the Law, now he allowed workes of mercy and workes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be done on the Sabbath day, as thoſe inſtances afore mentioned doe proue: but for any to ſuppoſe Chriſt meante hereby to aboliſh the Sabbath, is a ſimple conceipte, for Chriſt ſaith of the Morall Law, vvhereof the Sabbath day is a branch, He came not to deſtroy the Law but to fulfill it, Mat. 5.17. But ſuppoſe the Sabbath had beene a branch of the ceremoniall Law, why yet tis abſurde to think that Chriſt would abrogate any thing of it ſo long as he liued, for the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law was equally in force with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law vntill Chriſts death: So then theſe things did not argue any abolition of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day then, but rather giues vs to vnderſtand how we Chriſtians are to keepe the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to the worlds end, not in any ſuperſtitious ſtrictnes as if vve might not on that day doe works of mercy and neceſſity, but the contrary; for if Chriſt allowed it to the Jewes, euen before his death whilſt no man doubtes but all Lawes morall &amp; ceremoniall were in force; why ſhould vve thinke but that he allowed as much libertie to Chriſtians to the vvorlds end?</p>

               <p>I anſwere firſt to the former; Say I ſhould graunt that Chriſt the Lord of the Sabbath may or might change the Sabbath, whats that to our queſtion? vve diſpute not of what Chriſt may or might doe, but what Chriſt did doe? I anſwere to the latter; that neither the context, nor yet the phraſe, of Chriſt being Lord of the Sabbath; will afforde any ſuch matter: ſee the abſurdety of ſuch collections from a like phraſe, Rom. 14.9. Chriſt died, and roſe againe, that he might be Lord both of the deade and of the liuing: can any hence collect, that becauſe Chriſt is called Lord of the liuing? that therfore Chriſt might or did aboliſh or deſtroy the liuing? 2. to ſuppoſe Chriſt here did aboliſh the Sabbath day as a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, is altogether growndleſſe, for both at this tyme when Chriſt ſpake theſe vvordes, all ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies vvere in full force; and alſo ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained euer after, vntill the day of his death and paſſion; for not vntill then was the handwriting of ordinances taken out of the vvay Col. 2.14. nor vntill his death, did Chriſt euer aboliſh any ordinance formerly in vſe in the Iewiſh church: To conclude, no more can be gathered out of this text Mat, 12.8. but the right vſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21142:66"/>Chriſt freeing it from the ſuperſtitions of the Phariſes, who held that no worke might be done in no caſe vpon the Sabbath day, but Chriſt ſhewed that in a caſe of neceſſity his Diſciples might plucke and rubb a fewe eares of corne, to ſatiſfie preſent hunger; &amp; Chriſt did beare them out in it, allowing a diſpenſation in ſuch a eaſe; for, as he vvas Lord of all the commandements, as touching his Godhead; ſo of the Sabbath day alſo, and therfore he might diſpenſe vvith that law, and that day; or rather, he might therfore be betruſted to haue giuen the true ſenſe and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the commandement, and to haue ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne them the right vſe of a Sabbath day: as if he had thus ſaid, ſince I am Lord of the Sabbath, doe not you Phariſies think that I vvill giue way no not to my Diſciples to doe any vnlawfull facte on this day, nor ſuffer them to prophane this ſacred tyme, for it is myne, I am Lord of it, if therfore their plucking eares of corne had bene blame worthy, you ſhould haue found me ſo farre from defending them, as I vvould haue bene the firſt that would haue rebuked them for it; but herein I ſee they haue done no more then I doe allowe them to doe: the Lord of a corne field vvill allow his ſeruants, to make a footpath through his corne, in caſe of a neceſſity.</p>

A man may judge of the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this argument, by a like abſurdety that vvill by as good reaſon be thence concluded, for if the ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne in Ioſhuahs ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, could make, that tyme vvas changed and the Sabbath day, then the ſame ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne then did make that tyme vvas changed, and the Sabbath day too, euen then at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Ioſhuas tyme, when the Sunne ſtood ſtill; and if then changed, ſo then aboliſhed; and ſo there was no Sabbath in Gods church neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ioſhuas dayes: yea, if tymes formerly appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Law vvere now changed by ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne, how did the Iewes euer after to know vvhich was the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the month for the Paſſeouer? and the 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day for Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſte?</p>
               <p>I anſwere 2. that it doth not followe that the Sunne ſtanding ſtill, tyme is changed; but admit it were, and that the tyme being changed, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath is changed, as a parte of tyme, yet is it not changed in ſuch reſpect as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, and as I vrge it: Note therfore a day
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21142:68"/>may be conſidered as a certaine duration and ſpace of tyme, conſiſting of ſo many howres: or, and that more properlie for the Light, as Geneſ. 1.5. God called the Light, Day: Now be it the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath vvas changed, conſidered as a parte of tyme, yet was it not changed by the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill of the Sunne, as a Light; for though ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne made that day a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger day (as in Summer you haue a longer day then in Winter) yet not an other day: there was no change of light or day: &amp; for all the ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne, made one day a longer day, yet did it not make the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day or the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day and light, to be the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day or the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day &amp; light: nor did it tranſplace the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day or light, ſo out of its order, as that no man could euer after know vvhich vvas the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, vvhich was the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, or which vvas the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day or light that the Sunne made to the world.

A 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> reaſon, may fetch its ground from my anſwere to the reaſon laſt aboue, vvhere by Day I vnderſtood only the tyme of Light, and not a certaine ſpace and duration of howres, vvhence they may and commonly doe reaſon againſt the Iewes Sabbath by an abſurdety thus; if all nations be bounde to the Jewes Sabbath day (vvhich you ſay is all the tyme of light) then in ſome partes of the vvorld vvhere is halfe a yeere light together, there they muſt keep half a yeere Sabbath, &amp; then alſo more inconvenience, for that they are to haue a Sabbath, but once in the ſpace of 3. yeeres and an halfe, that is euery 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> halfe yeere, now in ſo long ſpace for people to vvant Gods ordinance of preaching, many a ſoule may periſh for vvant of Gods Word in the meane tyme.</p>
               <p>I anſwere 1. to this latter inconvenience, what though they had no Sabbath for 3. yeeres and an halfe together, no ſoule needes periſh for lacke of Gods Word preacht, for they may haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in meane ſpace as many as they pleaſe; ſince ther is a Comm: To preach the vvord in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, at all tymes and occaſions: I anſwere 2. to the former abſurdety, of keeping a Sabbath halfe a yeere together; I maruaile vvhy it ſhould be thought more abſurde for thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to keepe one in 3. yeeres and an halfe, half a yeere for a Sabbath, then it vvas for the Iewes

               <p>And thus you haue ſeene their artificiall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, againſt the tyme and day of the Sabbath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, now it remaineth that vve anſwere to their inartificiall reaſons and teſtimonies; the vvhich are fetched from the Primitiue Churchs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Teſtimony and Authority they produce againſt the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, is that of Ignatius in his Epiſtle to the Magneſianes, ſaith he: Let not vs keepe Sabbath, in a Jewiſh ſorte, reioycing in idleneſſe, for who ſo doth not work, let not him eate, as ſaith the Scripture: vvhere Ignatius vvould haue them not Sabbatize, but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21142:70"/>work rather on that day.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, let the vvords be well weighed, and they make nothing at all againſt the Sabbath; to this end note, a little before he had dehorted the Magneſians that they would not ſuffer themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to be ſeduced or deceiued with other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, nor with fables, nor vvith genealogies, nor vvith Jewiſh ſmoke: thus in generall: next, he deſcends to particulares, &amp; firſt he inueighes againſt the Iudiciall Law, and Circumciſion &amp;c. and this done, next he bringes in the vvords ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tod aboue, Let not vs keepe Sabbath &amp;c. now it is to be noted vnto vvhich of thoſe generalles aboue ſaid, from which Ignatius dehorted the Magneſians, theſe words haue relation: for my part I muſt thinke, they haue reference to thoſe words (fables, and Iewiſh ſmoke:) as if he had ioyned them thus; Suffer not your ſelues to be ſeduced with fables, nor Iewiſh ſmoke, or vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but cleaue vnto Chriſt, and let not vs keepe Sabbath as doe the Iewes &amp;c. thus he counted their Sabbatizing, ſuch as it was there, no clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Chriſt, but a vaine Iudiciall vanity: now that this relation muſt ſtand thus I proue. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpake of other doctrines, and of fables: now its fiteſt to referre Circumciſion to Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, becauſe it vvas a Drctrine once; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thoſe things he dehortes from on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as idleneſſe, and daunceinges, to the words
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21142:70"/>fables, and Iewiſh ſmoke. 2. Becauſe he dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them from obſeruance of the Iudaicall Law; now thoſe fables &amp; Iewiſh vanities of idleneſſe and daunceinges on the Sabbath, were neuer any ceremoniall Law, and therfore cannot be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that, foreſpoken of the Law. Now if Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius in this paſſage did not dehorte from any thing vvritten in the Law, touching the Sabbath, but from other fables and traditions of their owne, then Ignatius did not diſſwade from kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Sabbath, as it is commanded in the Law of 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: but from keeping of it according to their fabulouſe and vaine manner: let theſe two things therfore be noted: 1. that Ignatius did dehorte from things neuer commanded the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes in the Morall Law: 2. That the things he did diſſwade from they vvere fabulouſe and vaine things: as from eating meates dreſſed the day before; and from drinking lukewarme drinkes, (what he meanes by lukewarme drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I cannot imagine, I neuer reade of any ſuch drinkes forbiden in the Law) and from reioycing in dauncinges, and vnciuill how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or clapping of hands in the Sabbath day, and other like he diſſwades from; vvhich things are meerely Iewiſh fables and neuer found in Gods Law, vvherfore I conclude, that Ignatius did not forbidd an holy keeping of the Sabbath day, ſuch as ſtood with the Law of God, but he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21142:71"/>only forbad that carnall and ſuperſtitious kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it fore mentioned, ſuch as vvas neuer commanded by any law. That this is ſo, yet more plainly appeares, in that 1. in this very place and text, He doth exhorte the Magneſians to keepe the Sabbath Spiritually, in meditation of Gods Law, and in admiration of the workes of God. 2. In that Iguatius doth not diſſwade from kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Sabbath ſimply, but after a ſorte and in ſome manner: He ſaith not, Let not vs keep Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: but thus, Let not vs keepe Sabbath, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> after a Iewiſh ſorte, and faſhion, as reioycing in idleneſſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: ſo you ſee it is a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſenſuall reſt from labours, that this good man inuaigheth againſt.</p>
               <p>Only one thing in his diſſwaſion vvould be cleered, vvhich is that he addeth theſe words; Who ſo doth not labour, let not him eate &amp;c. theſe vvords are not to be taken ſimply, as if he would they ſhould work in their ordenary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings on the Sabbath day, for ſo we make him contrary to himſelfe, who exhorted them to keep the Sabbath day Spiritually, by meditation of Gods Law, and Gods vvorkes: now to work, and to reſt from vvorke (which the word Sabbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſignifieth) are contraries: beſides, how can a man ſo meditate on Gods Law, and the vvorks of God, as in a Sabbath one ſhould, whilſt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is in vnquiet labour? yea, in many callings,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21142:71"/>mens workes are ſuch as they cannot at all both doe their works, and alſo meditate Gods Law, as in the trades of grocers, and other retailing ſhopkeepers who ſell by little parcelles, and are euer in bargayning: ſo ſcriueners who are euer wrighting; and the like trades which occupie the minde; ſpecially if they kept market on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day as we doe, how could their mindes in the market be occupied about Gods Lawes? and it is to be noted Ignatius did not oppoſe Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Sabbatizing, or Reſting to Sabbatizing or Reſting ſimply, but thus he oppoſed Spirituall Sabbatizing, to Judiciall Sabbatizing fabulouſly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: vvherfore to ſalue all ſeming contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a fit ſenſe may be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the words, taking them to be comparatiuely ſpoken, as that they ſhould rather work on the Sabbath in an honeſt calling then ſo fabulouſly, carnally, and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, to ſpend the Sabbath in daunceing, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuile ſhowting, and the like; and here it ſeemes to me he alludeth to the like manner of ſpeech in Iſa. 1.13. I cannot ſuffer (ſaith the Lord) your new Moones, nor Sabbathes, my ſoule hateth your appointed Feaſtes &amp;c. now here God did not ſimply forbid Sabbaths, but that irreligiouſe, prophane, judiciall keeping of Sabbaths. Thus you ſee Ignatius his vvordes, makes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sabbath, being vvell conſidered of, but rather

               <p>Thus you ſee, neither their textes alleaged out of Scripture, nor yet their reaſons, nor their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies can proue the Reſt in the Lords Sabbath day, to be partly ceremoniall; nor yet the tyme and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day to be abrogated: So then in the laſt place I addreſſe my ſelfe to giue ſome poſſitiue reaſons to ſhew that the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath is ſtill in force, euen to this day, and ſo conſequently muſt be to the worlds end.</p>

               <p>IN the firſt place I would free the Sabbath day from a prejudicate opinion, ariſing in mindes of men from calling it, the Iewes Sabbath day: Touching which name, were it vſed in a good or in an indifference ſenſe I ſhould ſay nothing, but ſince I finde it ſo termed in a reprochfull ſenſe, to reſcue it herefro, I vvould faine know a reaſon why the Sabbath day, commanded in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: ſhould rather be called the Iewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, then the Lord our God, whom wee are commanded to worſhip in the firſt Com: ſhould be called, the Iewes Lord God? I can ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but that the one may be ſo called as well as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:21142:72"/>the other; Nor any reaſon but if we may call the Iewes God, our God; ſo vve may call the Iewiſh Sabbath day, our Sabbath day: and if vve doe not call it our Sabbath day, becauſe we keepe it not the faute is only in our ſelues: wherfore to auoide all difference about the name, let it not be called the Jewes Sabbath day, nor the Chriſtians Sabbath day, as proper to eighther; but let vs call it the Lords Sabbath day, as common to Jewes, and to Chriſtians both; and as appertaining vnto all nations, vnto whome ſoeuer the 10. Comm: doe appertaine: This name you ſhall finde juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy able by Moſes in Exod. 20.10. where he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it, the Lord Gods Sabbath; when he ſaid, The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. My firſt argument to proue the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath is ſtill in force, is becauſe the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, or Lords day, is not in force; and thus it may be framed.</p>
               <p>If our now Sabbath called the Lords day, which is eighther on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or on the firſt day of the week, be not in force, Then muſt the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, which is the day next foregoeing the Lords day, be now in force.</p>
               <p>But our now Sabbath, called the Lords day, which is on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or firſt day of the vveeke, is not in force. Therfore the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, vvhich is next foregoeing the Lords day, is now in force.</p>

               <p>I proue the conſequence to be good, becauſe eighther the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day muſt be Sabbath, the one of them, for of all the ſeuen dayes in the weeke, there is no ſcruple or queſtion betwene them, and me ſaue only about theſe two dayes, ſo as one of theſe two dayes muſt be Sabbath by both our conſents: eſpecially ſince we all hould it morall, that one day in euery 7. muſt be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which to deny were great impiety: I proue the Minor, that is, That the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, or Lords day, is not in force: and this I proue, becauſe ther is neither precept, nor practiſe, neither of Chriſt, nor of any of his Apoſtles in Scripture, to put the Lords day in force: and this taſke I haue parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and largely made good in the firſt parte of my Booke, where I haue ſhown by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, That the Lords day, is not a Sabbath day by Diuiue Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> argument is, becauſe the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath is not aboliſhed: and it may thus be framed.</p>
               <p>That which is not aboliſhed, that is now in force.</p>

               <p n="3">3. My 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> argument is, becauſe the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath was neuer changed; and it may thus be framed.</p>
               <p>That which was neuer altred nor changed, by Chriſt, or by his Apoſtles, That is ſtill in force to this day. But the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath vvas neuer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred nor changed, by Chriſt, or by his Apoſtles.</p>

               <p> For the truth of the Maior, 1. the vvrighting of this Law in Tables of ſtone by God, vvhat could it intimate vnto poſterity if not this for one, namly that thoſe Lawes ſhould be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall? elſe they might haue beene vvrote on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or parchement, or the like vaniſhing things. 2. what reaſon can be rendered, why God ſhould put ſuch an apparant difference twixt the 10.

This Maior is the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued truth at the hand of all Diuines, witnes Doctour Ames in his Theologicall Theſis pag. 499.

               <p n="5">5. My 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument is, becauſe there can be no day for a Sabbath vveekly and ordenarily but the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day: and it may thus be framed.</p>
               <p>If no day of the 7. can be Sabbath vveekly, but the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, Then muſt the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day now be Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</p>
               <p>But no day of the 7. can be Sabbath weekly but the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day.</p>
               <p>Therfore muſt the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day now be Sabbath day: the conſequence is cleere of it ſelfe, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21142:75"/>needs no proofe to him that howlds there ought to be a Sabbath, as we all doe.</p>
               <p>The Minor I thus proue, becauſe God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repeale or exception hath commanded vs, or at leaſt permitted and freely giuen vs leaue, to labour and vvorke, and doe all that we haue to doe, in thoſe 6. dayes whichgoe next before the Sabbath or 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Exod. 20.9.11. ſixe dayes ſhalt thou labour, and doe all thy worke, for in ſixe dayes the Lord made Heauen &amp; Earth &amp;c. ſo then we may worke vpon the Lords day, or any other of the ſixe dayes, and that by Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by his Morall Law; neither may it be thought that this branch of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, for the 6. dayes for labour, were neuer made typicall and ceremoniall, theſe were neuer ſhadowes of Chtiſt; yea, the Lords day it ſelfe vvas neuer excepted, for Chriſt himſelfe after his reſurrection did both trauaile vpon the firſt day of the 6. namly, the Lords day, a matter of 15. myles, and alſo approued of the like facte in the two diſciples by his iournying together with them to Emmaus that day Luk. 24.13. as hath beene more largly declared in the former parte of this booke: now looke what Chriſt did, the like we may doe ſafely; follow me as I follow Chriſt, 1. Cor. 11.1. ſaid Paul: ſo then Chriſts example is our pattorne and preſident, ſo as we may worke ſtill vpon the firſt day of the weeke,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21142:75"/>or on the Lords day: if then we may work vpon any of the 6. dayes, then are we not tyed to keep any of thoſe dayes a Sabbath in reſting from vvorke.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall thinke we now keepe the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day and that day which followeth theſe dayes labour: to him I ſay, that our Lords day vvhich we keepe is the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day or firſt day in the vveeke by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine accounte, and the 6. dayes labour ſpoken of in 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: are thoſe 6. dayes vvhich goe next before our Saturday, for thoſe are the dayes we are to imitate God by working in them, ſince we all confeſſe Saturday was the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, and that day whereon God reſted after his 6. dayes work, and ſince vve confeſſe thoſe were the dayes the Jewes till and at Chriſts death, did labour in.</p>
               <p n="6">6. My 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument is, becauſe God muſt haue one day in euery 7. dayes, from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the vvorlds end: and it may be thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>If God muſt haue one day in euery 7. dayes for a Sabbath, Then muſt he haue Saturday the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day for a Sabbath, and not Sunday the firſt day of the vveeke.</p>
               <p>But God muſt haue one day in euery 7. dayes for a Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Therfore muſt God haue Saturday the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day for a Sabbath, and not Sunday the firſt day
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21142:76"/>of the vveeke.</p>
               <p>For the Minor, it is confeſſed of all: and it may be proued by the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: vvhere the Lord ſaid, Remember the Sabbath, that is euery Sabbath: Againe, The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day is the Sabbath, that is, euery 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day is the Sabbath: like as, Thou ſhalt not kill, that is euery thou: Loue thy neighbour, that is, euery neighbour &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the Maior, I proue its conſequence; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, it being the laſt day of that vveeke, if you omitte it, making a change (for you ſay that day is changed, and if ſo, then it is omitted by juſt conſequence) &amp; giue God Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the firſt day of the next vveeke for it, then it is plaine God hath not a Sabbath in euery vveeke or 7. dayes, for the wanted one Sabbath, in that vveeke, wherin the change vvas made from Saturday to Sunday; now this lacke and want of a Sabbath in that vveeke, can no wayes be ſupplied, but by returning backe to giue God Saturday the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day againe; So then, if God muſt haue one day in euery 7 you muſt giue him Saturday which is the laſt of 7. vvithout any change to the day after: or elſe you both deny that in practiſe, vvhich euery man houldes in judgement to wit, that God muſt haue one day in euery 7. and alſo liue in the breach of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: vvhich enioyneth euery 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day: neither vvill it ſerue your turne to ſay, this change vvas

               <p n="7">7. My 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> argument is, becauſe God had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded vs the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath in his Morall Law: it may be thus framed.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer God hath commanded in this Morall Law, that is now in force.</p>
               <p>But the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his Morall Law.</p>
               <p>Therefore the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, is now in force.</p>
               <p>For the Minor, ſee it expreſly proued Exod. 20.8.10. Exod. 23.12. Exod. 31.14.15. Exod. 35.2. Exod. 16.29. Leuit. 23.3. vvhere, both the Sabbath day is commanded, and likewiſe the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day is commanded equally: and if any ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, a 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day is commanded, but not the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, I referre him to my expoſition vpon the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: and vnto the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> thing ther in, vvhere I haue ſufficiently proued that God pointed at one ſingular vvell knowne day from all others, and left vs not at rouers to take any day.</p>
               <p>For the Maior, namely, that vvhatſoeuer God hath commanded in his Morall Law, that is now in force: this Maxime is ſo Orthodoxe, as it ſhould trouble the conſcience of any man once to heare it queſtioned: fearing men hereby goe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21142:77"/>about to ſerue God by halues, and by peeces, to take and to leaue out vvhat they loſt, not hauing reſpect vnto all Gods Commandements: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naming and mention, that a thing is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and that in the 10.

I ſayes he this belongs not to vs, for tis impoſſible ſo intirely to loue God as with all the hearte: why may not the prophane man cauill againſt the Sabbath day, becauſe tis ſaid, In it thou ſhalt doe no worke, what not any manner of worke? vvhat not feede our children, nor cut our owne meate? this Commandement

               <p>Yet farther, ſince this is that generall truth, vvhich all Miniſters both in pulpit, and in their bookes, doe vphould vvhatſoeuer they ſay or vvright, that it muſt be ſo and ſo, becauſe God had commanded it in the Morall Law: vvhich particular flowes from this generall, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God hath commanded in his Morall Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

If ſo be that this

               <p>If they ſhall anſwere by any diſtinction, wher by they empaire the full force and virtue of any branch of this Law of God, they offend againſt a plaine texte Deut. 12.32. whatſoeuer I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, you ſhall take nothing therefro: yea they falſify Chriſts words and predication, Mat. 5.18. vvho confirmed the Law, and euery iote &amp; title in it, to abide in ſuch force as it was in, when he preached that ſermons in Mat. 5.18. thence forwards vnto the vvorlds end: yea, &amp; they ſide it vvith theſe Prieſtes Zepha. 3.4. who wreſted the Law; or, vvho did violence to the Law of Scripture, vve haue but two parts left vs, the one is the Law Morall, the other is the Goſpell: now whoſoeuer ſhall enfring or deny any iote or title of eighther of theſe portions of holy writt, he is no freend to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neuertheleſſe, ſome thing may be ſaid to proue, that whatſoeuer God hath commanded in the 10. Commandements, the ſame is now in force: as 1. becauſe all the 10.

Our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe ratified the Morall Law, and euery iote and title of it vnto the vvorlds end, Matt. 5, 17.18. which is to the full, as much as can be deſired I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue: 3. If ſome thing commanded in the Morall Law doth not binde now, then are there not 10. Commandements, for there is but 9. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and an halfe, or but 9.

Farther note vvhat learned, Chemnitius ſaith vpon this Text, by way of expoſition, ſaith he; Iote is a letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, and a letter of the leaſt value of all the reſt in the Alphabet: and title (ſaith he) is as a pricke to a letter, or as a comma to a ſentence: ſo you ſee, Chriſt did ſtabliſh for euer, the very leaſt things of moment in the law: and thus is the minor made good.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe againſt this Text many anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res are brought, as 1. that by Law here is not only meant the Law Morall, but alſo the Law ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall: Here vnto I ſay 1. that it is a grownd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe anſwere, it hath no foundation in the Text, or context, for ſince all the Lawes, in the ſequel of the chapter, which Chriſt expoundeth, be only Morall Lawes and not Ceremoniall Lawes, why ſhould it be thought here ſhould be any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Lawes meant? anddoe vve not vſe to reſtraine generall words vnto the ſubiect matter of the text and context; vvere it not a racking of the vvord Law, Heb. 7.12. to vnderſtand it of all Lawes, Morall and Ceremoniall, vvhere the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21142:80"/>matter doth occaſion vs to limite it to the Leuiticall Ceremoniall Law? I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe Mat. 5.17. there the word Prophetes added to the vvord Jewe: thinke not I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophetes &amp;c. but I ſee no reaſon, why the word Prophetes ſhould haue any aime at the Ceremoniall Law, more then the vvord Law in verſ. 18. for the Prophetes vvere exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about the Morall Lavv, in vrging and expounding it, as Matth. 22.40. yea, ſince we finde this phraſe of, The Law and Prophetes, to be applied to the Morall, and not to the Ceremoniall Law, by Chriſt himſelfe, and that too in the ſame Sermon, as Matth. 7.12. why ſhould it be vrged any larger here? 2. By Law, here muſt not be meante the Law Ceremoniall, but the Law Morall only, for, Chriſt ſaith, he came not to deſtroy or looſen the Law, but to fulfill it; vvhich ſpeech cannot be true of the Law Ceremoniall, for he came both to deſtroy or looſen it as by his death, and alſo to fulfill it, as in his life, and by his death. 3. The tyme wherein Chriſt foretold the duration of this Law, was but about a matter of two yeeres before his death, at vvhich tyme euery iote and title of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Lavv, vvas to be vtterly deſtroyed, novv would Chriſt foretell touching this Law, that it ſhould endure as long as the Heauens and the Earth, when as with in two or three yeeres after
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21142:80"/>it vvas to be aboliſhed? nay, what likelihoode is there that Chriſt would conioyne the Morall &amp; the Ceremoniall Law together touching dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if they vvere both equally and a like to laſt, and to vaniſh together?</p>
               <p>A 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> anſwere is, that the duration of the Law here is but vntill Chriſts paſſion, which they would ground from thoſe vvords Mat. 5.18. Till all things be fulfilled: to this I ſay 1. This thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and croſſeth Chriſts vvords, in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent v. 17. I came not to deſtroy or looſen (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the Law &amp;c. but if the Law had retained its force but till his death, then Chriſt came to deſtroy or looſen the Law, for it muſt be his death or nothing that altred the Law, and vvhat vvas done by his death, that he came to doe: 2. This ſenſe were to make Chriſt words ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as if in former parte of the verſe he ſhould vowe not one iote of the Law ſhall paſſe, vntill heauen and earth paſſe, that is, not vntill this worlds end; and inſtantly ſhould adde vntill all things be fulfilled, that is, vntill a two or three yeeres hence. 3. The Law is to laſt after Chriſts paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is plaine by that of Paul Ro. 3.31. wher be ſaith, fayth doth not make the Law of none effect, nor they the Apoſtles of Chriſt, but they eſtabliſhed the Law: now this was after Chriſts paſſion: and indeed the Law muſt be in force to this day, to ſhew vs our fine, and to bringe vs to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21142:81"/>Chriſt, Gal. 3.24. further, all things ſhall not be fulfilled, vntill the miſtery of God be fulfilled Reuel. 20.7. and vntill Chriſti ſeconde coming Act. 3.21. and 1. Cor. 15.24.25.26.54. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A 3d anſwere is, that ſome iotes of the Law are paſſed, and doe not bind vs now, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Commandements, I am the Lord thy God, that brought the out of the Land of Egypt; and as the promiſe to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: That thy dayes may be long in the land, which the Law thy God giueth thee: thone of theſe concerned Egypt, the other Canaan, and both concerned the Iewes, but neither of them concernes vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Ergo: Here vnto I ſay 1. neither of theſe doe, nor euer did binde any, for theſe be but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and motiues to obedience of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, they be no commandements, ſince they command or forbid nothing, only they be appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances to the Commandements, ſo the Law whereof Chriſt ſpake, may ſtand ſtill as a Law, though theſe motiues faile, for God can moue vs to obedience by other motiues Euangelicall, as Rom. 12.1. and though theſe motiues vvere failed, yet vvere no parte or iote of the Law fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or paſſed, ſince theſe motiues were, nor Law, nor parte or iote of the Law: Againe 2. it cannot be ſaid that thes 2. motiues be failed to this day, for looke to vvhome they did at firſt belonge, to the ſame nation and people they doe at this day
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21142:81"/>belonge, that is, to the people of the Iewes, for the deliuerance out of Egypt, is yet true of their people, and ought ſtill to be a motiue to them, euen to the vvorlds end, ſo then though that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerneth not vs, yet is it not failed, ſince it is in force as largly as euer to the Iewe: vnto vs Chriſtians it did neuer belonge: for that other annexed to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: I ſee not but that may be generall to all nations.</p>
               <p n="9">9. My 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument is, becauſe the Sabbath day, is a meanes to keepe in memory the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſe worke of the creation: this argument is taken out of Exod. 31.16.17: and thus it may be framed.</p>
               <p>That thing vvhich vvas a ſpeciall meanes and helpe of Gods appointement, to keepe in his church, the memory of that memoriable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed worke of his to wit the creation of this world: That thinge and meanes, ought now and for euer, to be in vſe in Gods Church.</p>
               <p>But the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, was that ſpeciall meanes and help of Gods appointement, to keep in his Church, the memory of that memorable &amp; renoumed vvorke of his, to wit, the ereation of this warld.</p>
               <p>Therfore the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, ought now and for euer. to be in vſe in Gods Church.</p>
               <p>For proofe of the Maior, there is no man in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21142:82"/>our Church but freely confeſſeth, that both now and for euer, there ought to be an honourable, admirable, and thankfull remembrance of Gods workmanſhip in the creation of this world, as well as was in the dayes of Moſes, and of ould: if then it be granted, that there ought now to be a memory kept thereof, why ſhould it not be granted alſo, that that ſpeciall help and meanes, ordeined once of God for that end, ſhould now be in force and in vſe? 2. There was neuer any helpe or meanes, once appointed to keep memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the vvorlds creation, which was afterwards aboliſht, and if none were aboliſhed, then euery one that once vvas, remaineth ſtill: true it is, ſome Sabbathes were aboliſhed, as in Col. 2.16.17. but, we muſt know, there vvere 2. ſortes of Sabbathes: there were Sabbathes vvhich were ſhadowes or ſignes of the Redemption, the body whereof vvas Chriſt; annuall yeerly Sabbaths, theſe indeed be aboliſht by this text; now there vvas alſo Sabbaths vvhich were ſignes of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, vveekly Sabbaths, euery 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, now theſe vvhich were Sabbaths and ſignes of things paſt, as was the creation, theſe be no where aboliſhed: great is the difference twixt Sabbathes, as ſignes of things to come; and Sabbathes as ſignes of things paſt. 3. It is of as great neceſſity, if not of greater, that vve now ſhould haue all or any ſuch ſpeciall helpes and meanes to keepe in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21142:82"/>the vvorlds creation, as had thoſe Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in Moſes tyme, for, vve are a people as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of Gods workes of wonder, as were they: yea, and we be in greater danger of forgetting the vvorlds creation then thoſe Iſraelites, by how much vve liue longer after the creation then they did; ould done things weare out of memory.</p>
               <p>For proofe of the Minor; to vvit, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was an helpe, to keep memory of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. All men grant it, when they thus argue, that the Lords day was inſtituded for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the reſurrection, as was the Sabbath day, for memory of the creation. 2. I proue it from Exod. 31.16.17. where 2. thinges be to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, 1. that the Sabbath is called a ſigne, 2. whereof it is a ſigne, and what is the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed: For the latter, the thing ſignifyed by the Sabbath conſidered as a ſigne, is the creation of the vvorld in 6. dayes, and Gods reſt vpon the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day: ſince euery ſigne, muſt ſignifie ſome thing, and this Text mentioneth nothing but the creation, and againe, where God giueth a ſigne, he vſeth to ſhew vvhereof it is a ſigne, and here he mentioneth nothing but the creation, therfore the creation is the thing ſignified: and this truth may yet farther be ſhowne by the very Text v. 17. for in 6. dayes &amp;c. vvhere note that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew vvord tranſlated, for, may alſo be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that, as thoſe ſkilfull in the tounge know
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21142:83"/>well, and finde ſondry examples in Scripture: yea, the vvord (for) muſt be tranſlated (that:) to make good ſenſe: ſo then, reade the Text thus; that in 6. dayes &amp;c. and you haue good ſenſe; &amp; alſo you ſee it plaine, that the Sabbath was a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that in 6. dayes God created and reſted: and the creation vvas the thing ſignified by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</p>
               <p>The other thing to be conſidered in the text, is, that the Sabbath is called a ſigne: and hence I thus argue; If ſignes be helpes and meanes to bringe to minde or keep in memory the things where of they be ſignes, then doth the Sabbath day helpe vs to minde and keep in memory the vvorlds creation: but ſignes be helpes &amp; meanes to bringe, to minde, and to keep in memory the things whereof they be ſignes: therfore the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day doth helpe vs to minde and to keepe in memory the worlds creation, the conſequence is good, it proceeding from the genus to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the Sabbath day being one kinde of ſignes; and what belongeth to all ſignes, appertaineth to euery or any ſigne. I proue the Minor, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of particulares; the raine-bowe in the cloudes, Geneſ. 4. it is called a ſigne or a token v. 13. and the Lord ſaid, He vvould looke vpon the bowe, that he might remember the couenant (which vvas the thing ſignifyed by the bovv) v. 16. The Paſſeouer vvas a ſigne or token Exod.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21142:83"/>12.13. vvhich when the Angell of the Lord ſaw, then he remembred the couenant, and ſpared them. Circumciſion Geneſ. 17.11. it vvas a ſigne and token, to put them in minde of Gods coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made vvith Abraham &amp;c. and ſee Exod. 31.13. a text pregnant to the ſame purpoſe: The Sacrament of the Lords Supper it is a ſigne; and this ſigne is to be vſed in remembrance of the thing ſignified, vvhich is Chriſt, 1. Cor. 12.24. neither can any example be ſhowne to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for, it is the very nature of a ſigne, to bring to minde the thing ſignified: I conclude, as the Lords Supper is a ſigne of the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; So the Sabbath is a ſigne of the work of creation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. My 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument is, becauſe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day putteth vs in minde, vvho it is, that is our Sanctifier, namely the Lord our God: This argument is taken out of Exod. 31.13. and it may be thus framed.</p>
               <p>That thing vvhich in the tyme of Moſes, vvas vſed as an helpe and meanes, to put the children of Iſrael in minde, vvho it vvas that ſanctified them; that meanes and helpe ought now and for euer to be in the Church; to ſhew vs vvho is our Sanctifyer.</p>
               <p>But the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, was vſed in the tyme of Moſes, as an helpe and meanes, to minde the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21142:84"/>children of Iſrael, vvho it was that ſanctifyed them.</p>
               <p>Therfore the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, ought now and for euer to be vſed in the Church, as a meane &amp; helpe, to ſhew vs, vvho is our Sanctifyer.</p>
               <p>For proofe of the Maior, 1. vvhat reaſon can be rendered, or inſtance giuen to the contrary, to ſhew that our churchs and people ſhould not now, haue the ſame meanes and helpes to put vs in minde, &amp; ſhew vnto vs vvho is the authour of our ſanctification, the which the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and Church of the Jewes had? 2. No helpe or meanes once appointed of God, to minde the Iſraelites, vvho did ſanctify them, vvas ener yet aboliſhed, and if neuer aboliſhed, then muſt they remaine: True it is, Sabbathes ceremoniall, and annuall, which were ſignes of Chriſt, and of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, ſuch were aboliſhed in Col. 2.16.17. but Sabbathes Morall, and weekly, vvhich vvere ſignes of God the Father, and of ſanctification, ſuch were neuer yet aboliſhed: beſides, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes aboliſhed in Col. 2.16. were ſuch as were ſignes of things to come afterwards, as of Chriſt: but the Sabbathes Morall in Exod. 31.13. were ſignes of things preſent, as of God preſently ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, as you may ſee in the Textes. 3. Wee now in theſe tymes, haue as much neede of that help, to put vs in minde of God our Sanctifyer, as they had in former tymes; for inſtance, let a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21142:84"/>Chriſtian pray feruently; giue almes bountifully, hate ſyne vnfainedly; doe the duties of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conſcionably; preach powerfully; and in a word, liue holily and blameleſly in this euill vvorld; vvhereby he out ſtrippeth the men of this world, and is as a light ſet vpon an hill; is not this man in greate danger to be puffed vp vvith pride, as vvere thoſe Iſraelites Deut. 8.17, arrogating to themſelues the glory of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, forgetting God the author? and is not this man in danger, to vſe his giftes as if he had not receiued them, and to glorie in them as his owne, 1. Cor. 4.7. ſurely vpon a ſerch, we can not but confeſſe, vvee Chriſtians are as ſubiect to ſpirituall pride, and as backward &amp; ſluggiſh, to giue vnto God the glory of his mercifull work of ſanctifying vs, as euer were the Iſrael of God: now vvhat helpe could be better to foreward vs in this Diuine vvork of hallowing Gods name, then to haue once in euery 7. dayes, that 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day appointed of God, to be a ſigne and remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer vnto vs, that Jehouah the Holy God is that fountaine and authour of our ſanctification and holineſſe?

                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:21142:85"/>and the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, doe both notify but one tyme, which is the laſt day of the weeke: ſo them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned by God, and alſo permiſeouſly vſed Exo. 20.10. Leuit. 23.3. Exod. 31.15. there you haue them conioyned by way of appoſition, Gen. 2.3. Exod, 20.11. Exod. 16.29. Luk. 13.14. here you haue them permiſcouſly vſed the one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo as the name Sabbath, and the tyme the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, cannot be ſeparated. 2, Whereas they deny me the accident of tyme, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day ſee it expreſſely commanded in ſo many words, Exod. 16.29. Exod. 20.10. Exod. 23.12. Exod. 31.15. Exod. 35.2. and ſo you ſee not only the Sabbath is in force now, but alſo the tyme and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day.</p>
               <p>The other commone anſwere is, that the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: and ſo the Sabbath day are now in force indeed, as touching the Morality of them, but not as touching their ſpeciall application vnto the Iewiſh ſtate: Here vnto I ſay, it is but a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thing to thinke that eighther the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: or the Sabbath day, were ſo commanded and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God to the Iewe, as if made peculiar and proper to their ſtate, and not common to all nations; To this end, perpende we the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: to ſee if ought there be that might giue vs occaſion to thinke it vvas ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Iewiſh nation excluſiuely; or, if all Nationes might not equally participate vvith them, in this Commandement, as vvell as in the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21142:85"/>other 9. Commandements: In the Com: ye haue theſe things enioyned: 1. Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: 2. to reſt in it: 3. to keep it holy: 4. a daye 5. the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, or laſt of 7.6. becauſe God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth on that day. What is here now, that is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Iewe, ſo as other nations cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame? Cannot we in England, as well as they in Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 1. Remember the Sabbath? 2. reſt in it? 3. keep it holy? 4. a whole day? 5. the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, and laſt of 7? 6. in imitation of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he reſted on this day? could no nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Iewe obſerue thes 6. things?</p>
               <p>Perhaps it vvill be ſaid, The Sabbath, and ſo the Comm: was applied to the Iewiſh ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that reaſon mouing them to obedience of it, which is annexed to the Com: Deut. 5.15. namely, Gods bringing them out of Egypt: Here vnto I ſay, This motiue and reaſon may be ſaid to be applied indeed to the Iewiſh ſtate excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely, as not belonging to other nations, and if they meane no more but thus: that the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: and ſo the Sabbath, are not now in force, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this ſpeciall application only to the Iewiſh ſtate, becauſe the Lord brought them out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, &amp; that this reaſon ſhould not now be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly preſſed vpon vs Chriſtians; I am not againſt it, nor doth it at all helpe them: who goeth about to proue the Sabbath is in force now to vs, with relation to that reaſon, of Gods bringing Iſrael
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21142:86"/>out of Egypt? or to moue Chriſtianes to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by that reaſon? The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com: ſtands on two partes; The one is Law, commanding or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding ſome thing to be done, this part only I vrge: The other part is reaſon or motiue, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to obedience of the Law, now this I vrge not, nor neede I, for it is no Law properly, for it nor forbides, nor commandes any thing: Be it, that the Law as touching the motiues be applied ſpecially to the Iewiſh ſtate, yet the Law as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all things commanded or forbidden in it, is vniuerſall to all nations.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing proued the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath is ſtill in force to this day: in next place I will ſhew you how this Sabbath hath beene practiſed and in vſe in the Chriſtian Church both in the dayes of the Apoſtles, after Chriſt his reſurrection; and after alſo in the more primitiue churches: for the practiſe of the Apoſtles I doe the rather produce it, becauſe the contrary ſide I ſee leane much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their practiſe, labouring much though all in vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne (as hath beene ſhowne) to proue the practiſe of the Apoſtles vpon the Lords day; vvherfore ſince Apoſtles practiſe, is vvith them of ſo great ſtrength, if I ſhall proue now, that the Apoſtles practiſed the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, I truſt they will forth with yeeld, that the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath is now in force, &amp; make no further queſtion of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:21142:86"/>
               <p> For this purpoſe looke Act. 13.14.15.16. Act. 13.42.44. Act. 16.13. here ye ſee 3. ſeuerall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and in two ſeuerall places, the Apoſtles preached vpon the Sabbath day: and ſee Act. 17.2. Paul as his manner was, vve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in vnto them, and three Sabbath dayes, diſputed with them, by the Scriptures: Here you ſee in an other place and Church, three Sabbaths more kept by Paul and thoſe that trauailed with him; nor was this any extraordenary thing: for the Text ſaith; it vvas an vſuall thing for Paul ſo to doe, Paul as his manner vvas &amp;c. and ſee Act. 18.4 here Paul in an other place and Church, namely, in the Church of Corinthe v. 1. diſputed in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue euery Sabbath day: ſo here was a conſtant practiſe, Sabbath by Sabbath; Euery Sabbath day ſaith the Text: and thus I truſt I haue more ſoundly proued, that the Apoſtles kept the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; and that conſtantly, and the ſame in ſoundery Churches, then they haue proued that the Apoſtles kept the Lords day: The keeping the Sabbath day, was an Apoſtolicall practiſe, but ſo was not the Lords day: Let the indifferent reader judge now and let him chooſe to practiſe that day of the twaine, vvhich he ſeeth moſt ſoundly and plainly proued before his eyes, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Againſt this be ſondry anſweres brought, as 1. True, Paul preached on the Sabbath day amongſt
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:21142:87"/>the Sabbath day, but they vndertooke indeed, but neuer did, nor euer will be able to proue the Apoſtles did conſtantly keep the Lords day, ſo in this point of Apoſtles practiſe, I haue the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, ſince they can not proue Apoſtles conſtantly kept the Lords day amongſt nor Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, nor Gentiles, no nor Iewes and Gentiles mixt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I produce an other Text againſt theire anſwere, ſhewing the Apoſtles preached amongſt the Gentiles, in which Text is not the leaſt grownd for any ſuch exception, as to ſay, there was a mixture of Iewes and Gentiles: ſee Act. 16.12.13. here Paul and Timothie preached on the Sabbath day: and note 1. that there was no thing conſtrayning them to preach, rather on this then on any other day, vnles it were the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: they had beene there as the Text ſaith, certaine dayes; and of all thes dayes, the Sabbath day vvas choſen; &amp; what can be thought ſhould incline them to this choiſe, but the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comm: 2. Note, here is not any reaſon to thinke here were any Iewes, becauſe vve reade not of any Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagues the Iewes had here: &amp; the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the open fields, beſides a riuer to pray, as the Text ſpeaketh, and therfore not with the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes in their Synagogues, as they were wonte to doe where the Jewes had Synagogues. As for Lydia, it will not follow ſhee was a Ieweſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21142:87"/>the Text ſaith, ſhee was a vvorſhipper of God: for ſo was Cornelius Act. 10.2. but yet no Iewe, no nor any proſelyte, for he vvas vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed then, Act. 11.3. finally, I ſay, ſuppoſe here was a mixture of Iewes and Gentiles, and alſo in that other place Act, 13.42.44. yet ther is no cauſe of ſcruple or doubt, that the Apoſtles would vſe any ceremonies (as they ſuppoſe the Sabbath) to be amongſt thoſe Iewes that vvere mingled with the Gentiles, no more then they would amongſt the Gentiles alone; for, ſaith the Text Act. 21.21. Paul taught thoſe Jewes that were mixed among the Gentiles, to forſake Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies &amp;c. and you ſee it his practiſe Gal. 2.11. he would not endure no not a Peter to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daize it amongſt the Gentiles; and can we thinke himſelfe would doe vvhat he reproued in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? beſides, it was againſt reaſon, for ſo he ſhould builde vp things (as ceremonies) which he labored to deſtroy, Gal. 5.1.2. I ſay build vp, for Paul counted Judaiſing amongſt Gentiles, a conſtraining of thoſe Gentiles vnto Judaizme, Gal. 2.14. for all this, I deny not, but Paul did Iudaize, but it was only in ſuch places of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie where vvere none but Iewes only, as at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and the like places, Act. 21.17.20.26. but in aſſemblies mixed of Iewes and Gentiles, there he would not Iudaize, leſt he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the Gentiles to Iudaizme, as hath beene ſaid.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:21142:88"/>
               <p> An other and ſeconde anſwer vſually brought againſt this practiſe of the Apoſtles is, that Paul did keepe Sabbath here vvith the Iewes, to beare with their weakeneſſe for a tyme, and as he did Iudaize it by circumciſion of Timothie: Here vnto I ſay 1. it appeareth he did not keepe Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath only for the Iewes ſake, for then vvould he not haue kept the Sabbath with the Gentiles, as he did: 2. vvas it a weakeneſſe in the Iewes to yeeld obedience to a morall precepts, to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com? 3. The things vvherin properly Paul was ſaid to Iudaize, were Ceremoniall things, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in force by the Ceremoniall Law, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and the Reſt, but things ſtanding in force by the Morall Law, as doth the Sabbath day, performance of theſe is no Iudaizing, but Moralizing, if I may ſo ſpeake.</p>
               <p>A 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> anſwere is, that the Apoſtles muſt take ſuch dayes, as they found in vſe in the Church then, or elſe they cold not preach and divulge the Goſpell: and the Iewes then would aſſemble on no dayes but the Sabbath: Here vnto I ſay, the Apoſtles cold make knowne the Goſpell, though they had neuer frequented the Iewes vſuall aſſemblies, for the Apoſtles taught and preached Chriſt, in priuate houſen, from houſe to houſe Act. 5.42. and when Paul forſooke prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the Synagogue, he taught elſe, where as in the Schoole of one Tyrannus, and there fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:21142:88"/>him both Iewes and Grecians Act. 19.9.10. yea, Paul cold aſſemble the Iewes them ſelues vpon occaſion, &amp; the very chiefe of them refuſed not to aſſemble at his calle, Act. 28.17.20. wherefore, neceſſity compelled him not to keepe the Sabbath vvith them.</p>
               <p>To make a more full anſwere to thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obiections vvhich they bring againſt the practiſe of the Apoſtles, in keeping the Sabbath day: one of vvhich maine obiections is that fore ſpoken of to this effecte, true the Apoſtles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, but it was amongſt the Iewes, not amongſt the Gentiles: where vnto I ſay, vvhat and if it vvere only amongſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves? are therefore the Apoſtles practiſes and actions vnvvareantable and vnimitable, becauſe they vvere done amongſt the Iewes? are all their actions amongſt Jewes but, of an indifferent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? if ſuch obiections be lawfull, if a preacher confirmes his doctrines in the pulp it, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Apoſtles, then is it lawfull for any thus to cauill againſt it, oh but that, it vvas done among Jewes: for inſtance, ſuppoſe this the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; Miniſters muſt preach conſtantly on the Sabbath day: novv after it is proued, &amp;c. then he confirmes it by the conſtant practiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Act. 13.14.44. Act. 17.2. Act. 18.4. is it tollerable for an auditor to cauill thus, oh this it

               <p>The laſt obiection is, that tis true indeed, the Apoſtles kept the Sabbath, but it was but for a tyme, till the Iewes vvere better inſtructed, the vvhich if they had refuſed to keepe, the Iewes vvould neuer haue heard them preach of Chriſt &amp;c. Here vnto I anſwere, this obiection preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth now as granted, two falſe ſuppoſitions; the one, that the Apoſtles vvould not (if they cold haue auoided it) haue kept this Sabbath: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Iewes vvere needleſly religiouſe, making conſcience of this Sabbath now, vvhen they neded not: for the former, for any thus to imagine or ſay is growndleſſe, for vvhere hath any of the Apoſtles declared themſelues any ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Morall Sabbath, that it ſhould be thought they had rather not to haue kept the Sabbath, then to haue kept it? for the latter, tis true, of Circumciſion, it might be ſaid the Iewes vvere needleſſely religious and carefull of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vve finde the Apoſtle inueighing againſt it Galat. 5.2. but how can vve ſay ſo of the Iewes as touching the Sabbath day, ſince vve no where finde the Apoſtles inueighing againſt it, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Iewes for keeping it, as they did for Circumciſion? The maine errour in theſe obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is, that they take it for granted vvhich is not granted, that is, ſuppoſing the Sabbath day in

In a word, is it not plaine the Sabbath was in vſe in the Church, vntill the yeere of Chriſt 364. at vvhat tyme the Laodicean coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile enacted a Law againſt it, and for the Lords day?

I anſwere, vvhy Ceremoniales in theire tyme, vvhilſt they ſtood in force, called for obedience, as vvell as Moralls, yea the firſt Sabbath of the Paſſeouer; which followed next day after Paſſeouer day, it vvas eommanded to be kept juſt as a Sabbath, in holy conuocations, and in reſting from ſeruile la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Leuit. 23.7. yea, death vvas to be inflicted vpon the breakers of this Ceremoniall Sabbath, Numb. 9.13. as vvell as vpon thos that violated the Morall Sabbath, Exod. 31.15. The ſumme of vvhich is this; That ſince the Ceremoniall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, whilſt in force, did binde as ſtrictly, as did the Morall Sabbath, therfore there is the ſame reaſon and the regard, of the Ceremoniall and of the Morall Sabbath, for ſtrictnes of obſeruation; and therfore it followeth by like reaſon (as farre as man may judge) that if a diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in caſe of neceſſity, for a change of that day, ſo a diſpenſation likewiſe in like caſe, is granted
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21142:97"/>for a change of the Morall Sabbath, ſo long as that neceſſity vnauoidably laſteth, vnles ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly we ſhould think, God is more ſtrict towards Chriſtians about the Sabbath, then he vvas to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Iewes about the Sabbath of the Paſſeouer.</p>
               <p>One obiection more, vvhat and if vve cannot haue publike aſſemblies in the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may are vve not bounde to keep the Sabbath as vve can priuately, euery man in his owne familie? I anſwere, ſince God had ordeined the Sabbath to be kept, vvith publike aſſemblies, and with the helpe of Prieſtes or Miniſters, as hath beene ſhowne, therefore I judge it better to alter the day, vntill the tyme of reformation, that ſo we might enioy the publike aſſemblies, and benefite of an able Miniſter on an other day, then without theſe, to keep the very ſelfe ſame day; that this opinion is juſtifiable, ſee the like practiſe of the good King Hezekiah, fore mentioned 2. Chron. 30.1.2.3. vvho becauſe the Prieſts were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to keep the Paſſeouer, in the firſt Month: nor vvere the people publikely aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame month, for theſe two cauſes the King with his Princes altered the day of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouer to the ſecond month. If any ſhall obiect or doubt that I ſtraine things to farre, when I wold juſtifie the change of the Sabbath, by the change of the Paſſeouer, becauſe theſe two are things of a different kinde &amp;c. and becauſe the reaſons
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21142:98"/>mouing vs to change the Sabbath, are not the ſame that God mentioned in the Law of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouers change Numb. 9.10. for ſatiſfaction of the vveakeſt in this point, I thus anſwer 1. to the latter, touching the reaſons of our change: they be not the ſame indeed euery way, yet if they be (as they are) as neceſſary to enforce a change, as thes, Numb. 9.10. it is ſufficient; and for proofe hereof, ſee it in the practiſe of King Hezekiah, who changed the day of the Paſſeouer, 2. Chron. 30.3. not vpon theſe very particular grounds, which God ſpecified in Numb. 9.10. for God ſpecified onely theſe two defilment by a dead corps: and being in a farre iourney: but Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah by like reaſon gatheted, that they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day vpon other grounds alſo, if as weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as thoſe firſt, and namely vpon theſe, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prieſts vvere not ſanctified: 2. becauſe the people were not aſſembled: ſo thes two differ both in the perſons, and alſo in the things, as may be ſeen by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring thos two textes together. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I anſwere to the former, and I juſtifie my arguing from the Paſſeouer to the Sabbath, from the practiſe of our Sauiour, who argued from Dauids eating the Shewbread, to the Sabbath, Math. 1.12.2.3. which were things farre more different, then the Paſſeouer day, &amp; the Sabbath day, for both theſe are of day and tyme, but thos were of bread and tyme: Further, by this practiſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21142:98"/>of Chriſt, I finde it lavvfull for vs to reaſon from a ceremoniall, as the ſhewe breade was, or by like reaſon, from a ceremoniall as the Paſſeouer was to a morall, as the Sabbath was: concluding that the ſame exceptions, and diſpenſations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to the morall Sabbath, which God granted to the ceremoniall Law of Shewbread, or to the Law of Paſſeouer, if there be neceſſity in the one as vvas in the other.</p>
               <p>For a concluſion let me ſtopp vp one gapp, wher at I perceiue ſome will be redy to breek out, ſaying, ſince that we haue not now the very day vvhich God ſanctified, but an other day in its roome, vve are not tied ſo ſtrictly to keepe this day, in the duties of Reſte and Holineſſe, as we ſhold be if we had the righte day, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vve may take liberty &amp;c. where vnto I anſvvere, hovv euer the right day is to be deſired principally, and before any other, and all good meanes to be vſed for obtayning it, yet vntill a tyme of reformation, I hould this day ought as ſtrictly to be Sanctified, as that other: ſuppoſe a debtor bound in a bond to pay 10<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day of March, and his creditor ſeing him in a ſtreight, and neceſſity is vpon him, ſo as he he cannot bring the mony iuſt vpon the day, in mercy the creditor permitteth him, to make payment on the next day after, on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day of March; ſhall novv this vnthankfull debtor,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21142:99"/>thus revvard his mercifull creditor, ſaying, ſince I carry not my 10<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. vpon the right day of my bond, being diſpenſed vvith all for the tyme; why therfore I nede not be ſtrict neighther in the ſome, nor yet in the currantneſſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I may take liberty and carry but 9<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. 10<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. therfore, yea and I care not if alſo I put in ſome light gould, and clipt ſiluer: is this good dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thinke you by the debtor towards his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull creditor? Why apply this, the caſe is thine, if thou vvilt giue Godleſſe dutie and ſeruice on this 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, then on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day: yea farther, conſider of that text Num. 9.12. vvhere though the Lord had permitted, that in a caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the tyme and day might be changed for the Paſſeouer, yet as touching the duties of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouer, to be by the Law performed in the tyme and in the firſt day, God vvold abate none of them, though vpon another day, for ſo ſaith the text, According to all the ordinances of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouer they ſhall keepe it. So may I ſay, of this firſt day of the vveeke (vntill a tyme of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and neceſſity be remoued) According to all the ordinances of the Sabbath, on the ſeauenth day, ſhall yee keep it.</p>
